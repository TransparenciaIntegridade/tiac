<p>With all of the design improvements to the plugin and theme screens in recent WordPress releases, the experience of updating extensions started to feel clunky and disjointed. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shiny-updates/" target="_blank">Shiny Updates</a> feature plugin was created to hide what project contributors refer to as the &#8220;The Bleak Screen of Sadness.‚Äù</p>
<p>WordPress users received a small taste of shiny updates when the feature was applied to plugin updates in the 4.2 release, but themes still lag behind. For example, when you update a theme, WordPress lets you know exactly how hard it is working behind the scenes to make that happen:</p>
<blockquote><p>Downloading update from https://downloads.wordpress.org/theme/cover.1.6.4.zip‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Unpacking the update‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Installing the latest version‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Removing the old version of the theme‚Ä¶</p>
<p>Theme updated successfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shiny Updates hides the ugly parts of updates in favor of making the process appear more effortless. Instead of taking the user to a new screen, updates happen in the background without the need to refresh the page.</p>
<p>The project is currently a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/" target="_blank">feature plugin</a> in development for WordPress core, led by Konstantin Obenland. In a recent <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2016/01/27/shiny-updates-v2/" target="_blank">status update</a> Obenland said that the new version of the plugin aims to extend shiny updates to all aspects of updates, installs, and deletes for plugins and themes in WordPress.</p>
<p>Version 2 of the plugin currently offers the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting single plugins, bulk updating, and bulk deleting plugins from the plugin page.</li>
<li>Shiny plugin installs from the plugin install screen: multiple actions can be queued up.</li>
<li>Shiny theme installs, updates, and deletes, multiple queue-able, including multisite.
</li>
</ul>
<p>Development for the Shiny Updates project is happening on GitHub where the team is <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues" target="_blank">collaborating on design and UX improvements</a>. One of their goals, according to the most recent update, is to refine the user experience by &#8220;improving perceived performance and limiting confusing notifications.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Update All the Things</h3>
<p>WordPress&#8217; update process is somewhat fragmented when there are multiple updates available for core, plugins, and themes on the <em>update-core.php</em> screen. Shiny Updates contributors are exploring <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/5" target="_blank">a button that would &#8220;update all the things&#8221;</a> in one pass. The dedicated issue on GitHub has 28 comments of discussion and design mockups for what an &#8220;<em>Update All</em>&#8221; process might look like.</p>
<p>In addition to adding an <em>Update All</em> functionality, contributors are also working on the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Development for <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/7" target="_blank">bulk plugin action notifications</a></li>
<li>Design for <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues/54" target="_blank">updating themes from the theme card</a> (on top of from details modal)</li>
<li>Another round of user tests to get more feedback on the new flows</li>
</ul>
<p>When asked whether Shiny Updates will be ready for inclusion in the upcoming 4.5 release, Obenland said, &#8220;Even though we‚Äôre fairly far into what we want to accomplish with v2, there are still a good number of tasks outstanding.</p>
<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm going to reach out to the a11y group for a review soon and have already gotten in touch with a few core committers to have the JS part reviewed,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We‚Äôre also in the process of running more user tests for the new flows. So the decision deadline next week just comes a little too early.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this time, WordPress 4.6 is a more likely target for including Shiny Updates in core. If you want to assist the team in getting it ready, install the feature plugin from the official directory or via the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/" target="_blank">Beta Tester</a> plugin. Testing version 2 should include both plugin and theme installation, update, and delete actions on both single and multisite installs. Testers can report any bugs to the project&#8217;s GitHub <a href="https://github.com/obenland/shiny-updates/issues" target="_blank">issues queue</a>.</p>

It&#8217;s also, to my knowledge, the first ever conference completely about a single feature of WordPress.</p>
<p>Put on by the <a href="https://hmn.md/">Human Made</a> team, there were definitely risks: maybe not enough people would sign up, maybe the content would be too dense, or not dense enough for the audience that showed, maybe the API wouldn&#8217;t be in core yet, and more. Yet, none of these things happened, and the conference was a success.</p>
<p>I had the privilege to cover the event as the media partner, and I had an excellent time. It wasn&#8217;t a small conference, with over 220 attendees, but it was intimate, utilizing a single track setup, and had a small hack day reserved for 40 people.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-20447" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-20-752x501.jpg" alt="ador-poststatus-20" width="752" height="501" /></p>
<p>It was also a bit of a risk to host the first A Day of REST in London, where it was quite accessible to the European community, but out of reach for much of the American market. Nonetheless, those of us that came from the US, Asia, and elsewhere were able to make mini-vacations of the conference, and the UK and broader European community made a great showing; the event nearly sold out.</p>
<h3>Why does the WordPress REST API merit its own conference?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://wp-api.org/">WordPress REST API</a> drastically changes the landscape for WordPress development. Now, WordPress can be the data store, while other technologies can (but aren&#8217;t required to, of course) take up pretty much every other aspect of the website. The front end and the back end components of a website can utilize completely custom web stacks, while the data is stored in WordPress.</p>
<p>The API can be used for modules within existing sites built traditionally with WordPress, or as the engine for entire external web apps. There are so many potential avenues to take WordPress with the REST API, that exploring just a few of them merits a conference like this. In fact, after having seen the conference, I feel that we just scratched the surface. That said, it was an excellent day, where I learned a lot. Here&#8217;s an overview of each speaker, and be on the lookout for videos as well, which will be hosted here on Post Status.</p>
<h3>Introduction to the WordPress REST API</h3>
<p>At A Day of REST, we were guided from the beginning, with an introduction to APIs within WordPress, and the role the REST API will play, by WordPress REST API Lead Developer Ryan McCue.</p>

<h3>The Building Blocks of a REST API project</h3>
<p>Next, Joe Hoyle &#8212; a core member of the REST API team, Human Made CTO, and my co-host on the Draft podcast &#8212; walked us through the building blocks of a REST API project.</p>
<div id="attachment_20457" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-20457 size-large" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-10-752x501.jpg" alt="ador-poststatus-10" width="752" height="501" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Joe Hoyle</p></div>

<h3>Unlock the Potential of the WP REST API at the Command Line</h3>
<p>Next, Daniel Bachhuber talked about creating a more RESTful wp-cli. The wp-cli project is a powerful suite of tools, but much of the functionality is replicated with the REST API. He&#8217;s in the middle of working through utilizing the REST API for wp-cli functionality.</p>

<h3>Building Calypso-like Applications with the WP REST API</h3>
<p>Nikolay Bachiyski was instrumental to the <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-mac-app/">WordPress.com Calypso project</a>, and in his talk at A Day of REST, he discussed Automattic&#8217;s thinking behind many of the technologies that were used, and some of what they learned.</p>

<h3>Pay No Attention to that WordPress Behind Your Application</h3>
<p>With perhaps the most fascinating topic of the day, K. Adam White discussed using WordPress in some quite strange ways, like in concert with Ghost, for instance. All of the talks are great to watch, but if you only watch one, I think this would be the one I&#8217;d choose.</p>
<div id="attachment_20437" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-20437" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-30-752x501.jpg" alt="K. Adam White" width="752" height="501" /><p class="wp-caption-text">K. Adam White</p></div>

<h3>Should I Use the WordPress REST API? Ask WIRED&#8217;s, &#8220;Ask a Flowchart&#8221;</h3>
<p>Kathleen Vignos is using the WordPress REST API at WIRED, where she&#8217;s the Director of Engineering. In this talk, she walks through how they decide when and where to use the REST API. They&#8217;ve gone through this process for considering the API for Latest Posts widgets, related post fallbacks, for Apple News and Slack integrations, and more.</p>

<h3>The Live Coverage Platform at The New York Times</h3>
<p>Scott Taylor &#8212; WordPress core committer and engineer at The New York Times &#8212; showed us how they use the WordPress REST API to power their Live Coverage Platform at The Times. It&#8217;s truly both WordPress and the API at scale, and he&#8217;s careful in his talk to discuss some of the issues that need to be resolved for WordPress to be the best choice for such applications.</p>

<h3>Hack Day</h3>
<div id="attachment_20424" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-large wp-image-20424" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ador-poststatus-43-752x501.jpg" alt="Hack day" width="752" height="501" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Hack day</p></div>
<p>The Hack Day was small, but productive. Around 40 people got together at the Mozilla offices and knocked out tickets, resolved longstanding issues, wrote docs, and updated the <a href="http://wp-api.org">REST API website</a> to officially deprecate version 1.x documentation.</p>
<h3>More pictures from A Day of REST</h3>
<p>Here are some more pictures I took of speakers, the audience, and the venue at A Day of REST. I really enjoyed this venue, which was exactly what I&#8217;d imagine an old and quaint English venue would look like.</p>

<h3>The future of A Day of REST</h3>
<p>Planning is already starting around what future WordPress REST API events may look like. Human Made is talking to potential partners (and in disclosure, I&#8217;m in these discussions as well) about potential events in the United States and Asia so far.</p>
<p>Feedback from A Day of REST was quite positive: more than 80% of attendees would definitely attend again, and nobody said they would definitely <em>not</em> attend again. For many, the depth of the talks and willingness for the conference to go deep on one WordPress feature was welcome, especially because this was an advanced audience of mostly developers, and not all just WordPress developers.</p>
<p>More than 20% of attendees consider themselves primarily JavaScript developers. I imagine the other 80% are all seeking to learn more about JavaScript, especially in context of its uses with the WordPress REST API, and considering Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s challenge during the <a href="https://poststatus.com/state-of-the-word-2015/">most recent State of the Word</a>.</p>
<p>I imagine will also be seeing stronger focus on the REST API at larger WordCamps. I could imagine simultaneous developer tracks and REST API tracks. And third party events like A Day of REST can go even deeper, with workshops and smaller group teaching, versus only speaker-driven events.</p>
<p>I love seeing people get together and learn. A Day of REST was productive, educational, and fun. I look forward to potential future iterations of this event, and getting back to Europe for a proper vacation (this was my first trip there!). Keep an eye out on Post Status for the official videos, and a round table podcast where I talked to many of the speakers about the WordPress REST API.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 03 Feb 2016 22:45:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Last weekend more than 200 developers gathered in London for a niche conference devoted to the WordPress REST API. <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/" target="_blank">A Day of REST</a> featured speakers from around the world who are building applications with the REST API at companies like WIRED, The New York Times, Fusion, Automattic, and Bocoup.</p>
<p>&#8220;The conference was a fantastic proof of just how popular the REST API project is, and it was super encouraging to see everyone there to hear about it,&#8221; Ryan McCue told the Tavern. McCue, a co-lead on the WP REST API project, said he enjoyed the opportunity to connect with the many developers who are already using the API in production. He also said he was surprised by some of the the speakers&#8217; unconventional uses of the API, including using it to supply content from WordPress to <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a> themes.</p>
<p>&#8220;The contributor day was wildly successful as we took a feature plugin approach to some long-standing issues,&#8221; McCue said. &#8220;We essentially split the room into six and let every team handle their tasks with fresh eyes. A huge amount of progress was made, and I&#8217;m hoping that this greater ownership of the contributions will encourage contributors to remain involved well into the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>McCue said three quarters of the WP REST API leadership team had the opportunity to meet in person and work through nearly all of their outstanding discussion items to get unblocked for future work.</p>
<p>In addition to being a boon to the REST API project, the conference was inspirational for developers who appreciated the in-depth technical focus of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think the most exciting point for me was the realization that the potential of decoupling WordPress from its codebase is far more complete and powerful than I had previously thought,&#8221; said Adam Hollister, an engineer who <a href="https://www.pragmatic-web.co.uk/a-day-of-rest/" target="_blank">attended with colleagues from Pragmatic</a>, a UK-based development agency. &#8220;I‚Äôm looking forward to building something with WordPress data in a way that would not have been possible until now.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Human Made Embraces Challenge of Hosting Conferences Curated for Developers</h3>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox.jpeg" rel="attachment wp-att-51148"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox.jpeg?resize=956%2C535" alt="a-day-of-rest-jack-lennox" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-51148" /></a></p>
<p>As many WordCamps are becoming more user-focused, developers are looking for events where they can expand their skills and learn from others in the industry. According to Day of REST stats from co-organizer Petya Raykovska, 41% of the 221 attendees were WordPress developers, 26% PHP developers, 21% JavaScript developers, and 12% other attendees (designers, product managers, and business owners).</p>
<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs more challenging to organize a niche conference than it is to organize a WordCamp,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;From the start we wanted to throw a very high quality event, especially curated for developers who want to improve the level of their work. That meant a very precise speaker selection for that particular audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>The organization team at <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a> wanted the conference to teach and inspire at the same time. Raykovska said that balancing the schedule to achieve this goal was one of their biggest challenges.</p>
<p>&#8220;At the end we are incredibly proud of the lineup of speakers we had and the feedback we‚Äôve been getting from attendees showed that people loved our speakers,&#8221; she said. According to a post-event survey, 81% of the attendees said they would definitely come back to the next event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also learned something very important &#8211; WordPress developers are eager to learn and are willing to invest to get better, especially with the upcoming challenges presented by the REST API,&#8221; Raykovska said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to learn about specific JS libraries and frameworks, application development, creating APIs, server setups for decoupled WordPress and many more advanced development topics,&#8221; she said. &#8220;There is definitely a niche for high quality development conferences to help WordPress developers expand their knowledge base and skills.&#8221;</p>
<p>Human Made is in the early stages of planning a second Day of REST conference that will likely be hosted outside of Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;We would love to continue organizing advanced development events to help the industry grow,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;We‚Äôd like to organize A Day of REST in the US and in Asia. Even though it‚Äôs too early for specific dates, the processes are already in motion.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those unable to attend this past weekend, <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/news/after-a-day-of-rest-slides-resources-and-more/" target="_blank">all the slides from the presentations</a> are now available and videos are coming soon.</p>

<p>These applications usually have great cover letters and well-put-together resumes, which is a good sign that people put some thought into it and had someone spot-check it before sending it in. But where most people list prior jobs, these applications (and LinkedIn profiles) list projects. When you dig into prior jobs listed, if there are any, they&#8217;re typically in a completely unrelated field like medicine or finance, and under education they list one of these new bootcamps, like Hack Reactor or App Acedemy.</p>
<p>Here I&#8217;m going to offer a key <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f511.png" alt="üîë" class="wp-smiley" />piece of advice to these folks to help their applications stand out, and can 100% compensate for their lack of professional experience: <strong>contribute to open source</strong>. &#8220;Projects&#8221; done in a coding bootcamp, even when they&#8217;re spelled out in great bullet-point technical detail, don&#8217;t really tell me anything about your engineering ability. Open source contributions show me a passion for a given area, ability to work with others to¬†have a contribution reviewed and accepted, and most importantly show actual code. Even better than one-off contributions, if you can grow into a recognized position in an open source project, that puts you ten steps ahead of applications even from folks with 20 years experience in the field, at least to an Open Source-biased company like Automattic.</p>
<p>Though I don&#8217;t know any of these boot camps well enough to suggest them, I love the idea in general. Even before the more formal bootcamps I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of examples of people who used free information and technology to rise to a very high level of technical contribution. In fact that&#8217;s very much my own story from the early days of WordPress. So in summary: it&#8217;s okay to learn to code through class projects, but show your value by getting involved in something bigger.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 01 Feb 2016 16:00:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is part of a new series where I share an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>
<h2>Taking Care of Each Other</h2>
<p>Rich Robinkoff has a great post that discusses <a href="http://rkoffy.com/wellness-in-the-wordpress-communty/">wellness in the community</a> and encourages the WordPress community to take care of each other. While it&#8217;s great to give back to WordPress, Robinkoff reminds us that we need to invest in ourselves before reinvesting in WordPress.</p>
<blockquote><p>Without giving back to ourselves, giving to the WordPress project would suffer. Invest in the wellness of WordPress by investing in yourself.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robinkoff is also working on a side project called <a href="http://wpambassador.com/">WPAmbassador.com</a>, a site that aims to bring people together. It will promote camaraderie and wellness throughout the community. It&#8217;s not ready yet but it may launch in February.</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t get a chance to attend or watch his presentation at WordCamp US, I highly encourage you to do so. However, tissues are not included.</p>
<div class="embed-wrap"></div>
<p>Rich is a great person and steward in the community. If you&#8217;re not already doing so, you should <a href="https://twitter.com/rkoffy">follow him</a> on Twitter.</p>
<h2>One of The Most Important Comments in WordPress&#8217; History Turns 13 Years Old</h2>
<p>On January 25th, 2003, <a href="https://mikelittle.org">Mike Little</a>, Co-founder of the WordPress project, <a href="https://ma.tt/2003/01/the-blogging-software-dilemma/">commented on</a> a blog post where Matt Mullenweg described his blogging software dilemma. It&#8217;s his comment along with a few others that inspired the birth of WordPress by forking b2.</p>

<h2>Prologue Turns 8 Years Old</h2>
<p>In January of 2008, Automattic <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2008/01/28/introducing-prologue/">released Prologue</a>, a simple, innovative theme for providing status updates. The company used password-protected Prologue sites to allow employees to keep track of projects and updates.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PrologueScreenshot.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51096"><img class="size-full wp-image-51096" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/PrologueScreenshot.png?resize=560%2C342" alt="Prologue in Action" /></a>Prologue in Action
<p>In March of 2009, <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2009/03/11/p2-the-new-prologue/">Automattic released P2</a>, the successor to Prologue. In 2014, the company transitioned internal sites to <a href="http://geto2.com/">o2, </a>successor to P2 and <a href="http://wptavern.com/o2-is-now-available-on-github">open sourced</a> its code in 2015.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Read The Comments</h2>
<p>Anil Dash <a href="https://medium.com/@anildash/against-don-t-read-the-comments-aee43ce515b9#.r110p33yi">published a great post</a> on Medium that looks at the phrase, &#8220;Don&#8217;t read the comments.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>We‚Äôve made a habit out of telling people not to read the comments online. But what started as a cynical in-joke has become a bad habit, and an excuse for enabling abuse across the web.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a phrase I&#8217;ve seen many people say on Twitter referencing comments to articles published on the Tavern. Dash goes on to say, &#8220;Preventing abuse online requires the people running a site or an app to invest time, effort and attention into protecting their community. That‚Äôs the bottom line.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why we created a <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wp-tavern-comment-moderation-policy">comment moderation policy</a> and are taking a more active role this year moderating comments. However, in recent weeks, I&#8217;ve noticed some of the same people who said the phrase above are now engaging in the conversation which is helping to calm the waters.</p>
<p>For those thinking about disabling comments or need a reminder as to why their important, considering the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>There‚Äôs a grave cost to assuming online interactivity is always awful. The burden is felt most acutely in denying opportunity to those for whom connecting to a community online may be the only way to get a foot in the door. Those underrepresented, unheard voices are the most valuable ones we lose when we throw the baby out with the bathwater and assume online comments are necessarily bad.</p></blockquote>
<h2>This Week in Core</h2>
<p>If you want to keep a close eye on WordPress core development, there&#8217;s no better way than reading <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/week-in-core/">This Week in Core</a>. Written and published by volunteers, the post highlights all of the noteworthy changes in an easy to digest format. Check out the most recent post that covers what happened in core between January 19-26.</p>

<h2>Envato Hires WordPress Evangelist</h2>
<p>Envato hired <a href="https://twitter.com/jamesgiroux">James Giroux</a> to be its <a href="http://inside.envato.com/meet-envatos-wordpress-evangelist/">WordPress evangelist</a>. In the post, he explains some of the responsibilities his role entails.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are many compelling stories to tell. Envato WordPress creatives from all over the world have done some truly innovative things to enhance the experience of everyday users. I want to find and help tell those stories in the WordPress community.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you&#8217;d like to meet Giroux in person, he&#8217;s attending <a href="http://pressnomics.com/">PressNomics</a> in March.</p>
<h2>How the REST API Changes WordPress Plugin Development</h2>
<p><a href="http://joshpress.net/how-wp-api-changes-wordpress-plugin-development/">Josh Pollock explains</a> how the REST API changes WordPress plugin development.</p>
<blockquote><p>WordPress didn‚Äôt get to 25% market share on blogs and it‚Äôs not going to get to 50% or whatever that way. The growth comes from eCommerce, publishing, membership sites, inbound marketers etc. These are all users that can benefit from being service providers.</p>
<p>I think that those of us who empower these users by giving them the tools needed to make their sites have to think API first. Your plugin‚Äôs interaction with the client is going to be more and more coming through the API.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Is WordPress Made of Spaghetti Code?</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;ve been around the WordPress ecosystem for any length of time, you&#8217;ve likely run into a conversation or two where someone says WordPress&#8217; code is a mess. On the <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/is-wordpress-code-really-a-mess/">Kinsta blog</a>, Daniel Pataki takes a hard look at what bad code is, whether or not users care, and if it&#8217;s a legitimate reason to avoid using WordPress.</p>
<h2>Wapuutah!</h2>
<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.</p>
<p><a href="https://2015.slc.wordcamp.org/08/18/meet-wapuutah-the-wordcamp-slc-wapuu/">Wapuutah</a>, created by <a href="https://twitter.com/supernovia">Velda Christensen</a>, represents <a href="https://2015.slc.wordcamp.org/08/18/meet-wapuutah-the-wordcamp-slc-wapuu/">WordCamp Salt Lake City, Utah, 2015</a>. As you can see, Wapuutah is decked out in camping gear and ready for an extended getaway in the mountains outside of Salt Lake City. I hope Wapuutah remembered to bring some bug spray!</p>

The purpose of the day is simple, give thanks and express gratitude to WordPress plugin and theme developers.</p>
<p>There are several ways to celebrate the event, such as visiting the plugin or theme author‚Äôs website. The link is usually available via the plugin or theme&#8217;s page on WordPress.org. If you&#8217;ve discovered a useful plugin, consider giving the author a monetary donation.</p>
<p>Another way to thank plugin and theme authors is to rate and review their work. Ratings and reviews are <a title="http://wptavern.com/rate-and-review-a-wordpress-plugin-day-set-for-october-17th" href="http://wptavern.com/rate-and-review-a-wordpress-plugin-day-set-for-october-17th">an easy way to send feedback</a> directly to an author. Make sure to provide actionable feedback instead of one or two-word reviews. A side effect of rating and reviewing plugins and themes, is that it‚Äôs one of many ways to contribute back to WordPress.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress theme directory</a> has more than 2k themes while the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">plugin directory</a> has nearly 47k plugins. That&#8217;s a lot of volunteer time, effort, and code donated to the community.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> to anyone who has ever published a WordPress plugin or theme whether it‚Äôs on one of the official directories or on GitHub. Without them, users wouldn‚Äôt be able to customize WordPress to make it their own.</p>

<p>Managing a WordPress site requires a basic understanding of how plugins, themes, and WordPress works. Thankfully, there&#8217;s a new guide available called <a href="http://nonprofitwp.org/">NonprofitWP,</a> by¬†<a href="https://mrwweb.com/">Mark Root-Wiley</a>, that tailors specifically to nonprofits that choose to manage their own sites with WordPress.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NonProfitWordPressGuide.png" rel="attachment wp-att-51076"><img class="size-full wp-image-51076" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/NonProfitWordPressGuide.png?resize=1025%2C646" alt="Front Page to Nonprofit WordPress Guide" /></a>Front Page to Nonprofit WordPress Guide
<p>The guide covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Things to know before you get started</li>
<li>Domains and Hosting</li>
<li>Installing WordPress</li>
<li>Choosing a Theme</li>
<li>Selecting Plugins</li>
<li>Entering and Managing Content</li>
<li>Keeping Your Site Healthy</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s also a <a href="http://nonprofitwp.org/resources/free-stuff-for-nonprofit-wordpress-websites/">resources section</a> with links to products and services that have special offers for nonprofits. Some of the products and services have an affiliate code that kicks back a certain percentage of sales to Root-Wiley.</p>
<p>Root-Wiley published the guide in an effort to help nonprofits make the right decisions, &#8220;A good WordPress website is easy to manage and maintain, but a bad one is time-consuming and expensive to maintain. Making smart decisions when you get started with a new WordPress site is¬†<em>key</em> to avoiding headaches later,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a lot of clients where our first project was cleaning up after a volunteer or staff member who tried to do the site on their own. Sometimes that&#8217;s a live site and other times it&#8217;s a refresh that&#8217;s hit a wall. One time, I was the ‚Äã<strong>seventh</strong>‚Äã developer on a project, but I was the first paid one and the one to launch the site.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many of the problems these projects run into are in the very early stages where they went all in with a bad theme, picked the wrong plugin, or quite commonly, didn&#8217;t think through or understand their organization&#8217;s needs and how those should translate to a website,&#8221; Root-Wiley told the Tavern.</p>
<p>Instead of publishing the information in an e-book, he used WordPress, &#8220;I chose to publish it as a website because I think that&#8217;s the most user-friendly format and I don&#8217;t want anything to get in the way with people accessing the information,&#8221; Root-Wiley said.</p>
<p>While he doesn&#8217;t plan to open source the site anytime soon, people can submit content suggestions and ideas through the site&#8217;s <a href="http://nonprofitwp.org/about/contact/">contact form</a>.</p>

<p>The WordPress community in Karachi, Pakistan held its first meetup last weekend led by <a href="https://twitter.com/sewabs" target="_blank">Waseem Abbas</a>. The gathering drew 125 attendees and organizers have been receiving <a href="https://www.facebook.com/s.wasim.abbas/posts/1064760890225282?pnref=story" target="_blank">positive reviews and feedback</a>.</p>
<p>The meetup featured two sessions, one on &#8220;WordPress Security&#8221; by Ahsan Parwez and the second on &#8220;WordPress Possibilities&#8221; by Usman Khalid. I spoke with Abbas who said that organizers were surprised by the depth of WordPress knowledge among the attendees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were expecting a beginner level audience,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;But when they started asking questions of the speakers, we were amazed. It is clear now that we should have more advanced discussions in future meetups. For the smaller beginner audience, we will be focusing on short live sessions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Karachi, with a population of 25 million people, is one of the largest cities in the world. Pakistan&#8217;s WordPress community is growing rapidly, as evidenced by the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-growing-in-pakistan-500-attend-lahore-meetup" target="_blank">local meetup in Lahore that recently passed 500 attendees</a>. Karachi is five times the size of Lahore and has the potential to be home to a much larger WordPress community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pakistan is ranked 3rd on <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/" target="_blank">freelancer.com</a> and most of the projects are based on WordPress,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;It shows how people are using WordPress to change their lives in Pakistan. Many of the big WordPress companies have employees working from Pakistan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Feedback from both Lahore and Karachi organizers indicates that the WordPress community in Pakistan is extensive, but 2015 and 2016 are the first years that leaders have emerged to get everyone connected.</p>
<p>&#8220;People are working on different WordPress projects and websites professionally but are not connected with each other,&#8221; Abbas said. &#8220;WordPress is used by hundreds of bloggers and developers, but they don&#8217;t have a platform to connect.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this meetup we have seen many business collaborations and idea sharing in the community,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It is a positive gesture and real motivation for us to scale the meetups in future.&#8221; The next Karachi meetup is scheduled for February 27th.</p>

According to the draft, new features should meet the accessibility guidelines before merging into core.</p>
<blockquote><p>All code released in WordPress must conform with the WCAG 2.0 guidelines at level AA. These basic guidelines are intended for easy reference during development, but do not cover all possible accessibility issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the document focuses on core, it&#8217;s also a great reference for developers who want their themes and plugins more accessible.</p>
<h2>Matt Mullenweg Addresses WordPress&#8217; Accessibility</h2>
<p>For the second year in a row, <a href="http://mor10.com/">Morten Rand-Hendriksen</a>, an advocate for improving WordPress&#8217; accessibility, brought up the topic during the Q&amp;A portion of the 2015 State of the Word.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Hendriksen notes that in 2014, the WordPress theme directory <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-suck-at-accessibility-its-time-to-fix-it">contained 14 themes</a> with the accessibility-ready tag. In 2015, that number increased to 79.</p>
<p>Hendriksen brings up the fact that when WordPress adopts modern technologies, so does most of the web citing responsive images as an example. He asks Mullenweg if WordPress can do the same for accessibility in which the audience responds with applause. Mullenweg responds with a simple yes.</p>
<h2>Thinking of Accessibility as Just a Checkbox</h2>
<p>Hendriksen then asks a follow-up question, &#8220;Can you tell everyone in this room and community that when they learn JavaScript, to also add on that little accessibility part, so that we&#8217;re building everything accessible and tell the world that the web should be accessible and that&#8217;s the WordPress way?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mullenweg responds by agreeing the web should be accessible but says, &#8220;I&#8217;m worried about getting to a point where we think of accessibility like a checkbox. Even though there are great guidelines and things like that, I think that accessibility is a process and it&#8217;s going to be driven sometimes not by every single person, but by groups like the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/">amazing accessibility team</a> and most importantly by the people who need the technology, communicating, and us observing that.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, I do think that we have presentations on accessibility at every single WordCamp, we have the accessibility guidelines online but I think we&#8217;re a little behind on the theme reviews which is part of the reason the number hasn&#8217;t grown as much because the accessibility reviews are more difficult than a standard review, but I&#8217;m really excited about what this group has been able to do and the growing momentum it&#8217;s gained in the WordPress world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that saying I want things to be accessible moves things forward as much as the continuing education that we&#8217;re doing through every single WordCamp, the guidelines, and the group,&#8221; Mullenweg said. He also highlights the need to think of accessibility in a global sense.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think about the 6.99 billion people who haven&#8217;t used WordPress yet and many of those who can&#8217;t. I also think about accessibility in terms of languages and touch devices.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are things that as we get there, what we do right can expand to a larger audience. I encourage everyone to keep that in mind, but learn JavaScript as well,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s responses reinforce the fact that accessibility remains a priority for the WordPress project.

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jackslingerland" target="_blank">Jack Slingerland</a> started hacking on WordPress in 2008, but recently his career has taken him a bit further afield from it than he would like. By day he is a Senior Software Engineer at <a href="http://www.ca.com/us/default.aspx" target="_blank">CA Technologies</a> in Raleigh, working in React/Redux, Node, ElasticSearch, Grails, and Groovy. But at night he is busy building <a href="https://kernl.us/" target="_blank">Kernl</a>, a service that provides private plugin and theme updates for WordPress.</p>
<p>Once a plugin has been added to the service, the updates delivered from Kernl will look exactly like updates from WordPress.org.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kernl‚Äôs core feature is providing private plugin and theme updates for WordPress developers. However, our differentiating features are what get me excited,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;We have purchase code validation (so only authorized users can download updates) and continuous integration (CI) support.</p>
<p>&#8220;The CI stuff is really neat, because it allows WP developers to push their code into GitHub or BitBucket and then have it automatically packaged and deployed to their customers. CI has been traditionally hard to do on WordPress because your ‚Äòproduction‚Äô environment is often something you don‚Äôt control,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Kernl solves that problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea for Kernl came to Slingerland after previous years trudging through client work.</p>
<p>&#8220;One thing that constantly nagged at me was how hard it was to get any bug fixes or feature updates out to my clients,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I often didn‚Äôt manage their sites, so getting them updates involved lots of emailing and communication overhead.</p>
<p>&#8220;I originally had the idea for Kernl back in 2011, but never executed on it until last year,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;I was hoping that I could help other people solve the same problem I had.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kernl launched in private alpha in May 2015 with ~65 alpha users. In November he opened it up for public beta and the service now has approximately 100 beta users. Testers are currently putting Kernl through its paces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kernl hosts 73 plugins &#038; 43 themes (117 total)</li>
<li>The service processed 4.07 million update checks since May</li>
<li>Kernl processes around ~2 update status checks / second</li>
<li>14,100 updates have been downloaded from Kernl</li>
</ul>
<h3>How does Kernl compare to WP Pusher?</h3>
<p>I asked Slingerland about how Kernl measures up to <a href="https://wppusher.com/" target="_blank">WP Pusher</a>, which allows developers to deploy WordPress themes and plugins from GitHub and Bitbucket.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kernl doesn‚Äôt require your end-user to install anything besides your plugin/theme,&#8221; Slinglerland said. &#8220;If I understand WP Pusher correctly, you first install WP Pusher, then tell WP Pusher to manage updates for a given plugin/theme via it‚Äôs version control repository. But this has to happen on every end user installation and might feel complicated to non-technical users.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kernl works seamlessly with your plugin/theme, just like those that are installed from the WordPress.org repository.  This makes installing and updating feel familiar and blend in seamlessly,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We also have purchase code validation, which is going to be getting some love and an API after we go live.  Kernl also supports versioning your plugin/theme, so intermediary commits don‚Äôt get randomly sent out to your customers.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Importance of Continuous Integration</h3>
<p>One of the reasons Slingerland built Kernl is because he wants to help more WordPress developers add continuous integration to their workflows. This particular aspect of the app (the &#8220;push to build&#8221; feature) posed the biggest technical challenge but was one of the most important problems for Kernl to solve.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are a lot of edge-cases that I didn‚Äôt foresee, especially once I started integrating with both BitBucket and GitHub,&#8221; Slingerland said. &#8220;In these cases the beta testers were invaluable in helping ferret out bugs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a solid continuous integration and deployment workflow really changes the way you think about development,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Instead of having &#8216;big bang&#8217; once a quarter feature releases, it becomes easier to iterate on your idea. Fail fast, validate your ideas/changes, and iterate again. It‚Äôs a big enabler of the Agile development methodology, and I feel that the WordPress plugin/theme community has kind of lacked that. It encourages good testing as well, which is almost required if you are deploying continuously.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slingerland is aiming Kernl at developers who create WordPress plugins and themes that are not hosted on WordPress.org. A handful of his beta users have even been using the service to distribute updates for their own beta testers before they publish an official release to WordPress.org.</p>
<p>Kernl will host any plugin or theme for free as long as it is both open source and freely available. Pricing for commercial plugins and themes will range from $5 &#8211; $25/month. The service is free to use during the beta period, which is planned to be wrapped up in mid-February.</p>
<h3>Kernl Will Not Police Product Licensing</h3>
<p>After further inquiry regarding Kernl&#8217;s position on the licensing of products it hosts, Slingerland states that he will not police his customers&#8217; licensing. This means that authors of non-GPL themes and plugins would be welcome to distribute their software via his platform. Since themes and plugins are derivative works of WordPress, they are required to be licensed under the GPL.</p>
<p>Slingerland&#8217;s lack of willingness to police non-GPL software has the potential to make Kernl a hive for products that break WordPress&#8217; license. The service makes it easy to distribute non-GPL software that masquerades in the admin as regular compliant plugins/themes when it comes to updates.</p>
<p>Distributing non-GPL software can be a deal breaker for WordPress developers who feel strongly about the GPL. The GPL protects users&#8217; freedom to use and modify the software for any purpose, and many developers have built their businesses and reputations on upholding that freedom.</p>
<p>Software hosted by Kernl may or may not comply with GPL licensing, and the user may never know. This leaves the user vulnerable in a way that official updates from WordPress.org does not. Developers who don&#8217;t want to be parcel to supporting a platform that has the potential to distribute non-GPL software may want to look for an alternative.</p>

<p>WooCommerce, which currently powers roughly 30% of online stores, has a growing catalogue of <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/" target="_blank">355 extensions</a> ranging from free to $249. Most of the major payment gateways are offered at $79 per single site license. There are also <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=woocommerce" target="_blank">hundreds of additional extensions</a> hosted on WordPress.org, including several payment gateway plugins that, if listed on the WooCommerce site, would be in direct competition to its major money makers.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/paypal-for-woocommerce/" target="_blank">PayPal for WooCommerce</a> is one such competitor. It adds PayPal Express Checkout, Payments Pro, and PayPal Plus (for Germany) to WooCommerce in a single, completely free plugin. It also utilizes all of the features PayPal provides in its APIs for seamless integration with WooCommerce. The plugin is active on more than 10,000 sites and has a 4.8/5.0 star rating on WordPress.org.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.angelleye.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Angell</a> developed PayPal for WooCommerce after finding inadequacies in the leading plugin options at the time. Prior to creating the plugin, Angell spent many years becoming a PayPal specialist, earning much of his income taking PayPal-related development projects. He is now a PayPal Partner, certified PayPal developer, <a href="https://www.angelleye.com/paypal-developer-certified-award-winner/" target="_blank">3-time PayPal Star Developer award winner</a>, and a PayPal Ambassador.</p>
<p>&#8220;I first started learning how to work with web services around the time PayPal had just released their first set of public APIs,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;Payment processing was very important to my general web development work, of course, so I took the time to learn how to tightly integrate the PayPal API, which really taught me how to work with pretty much any API at that point. During this time I spent a lot of time in PayPal developer forums.&#8221;</p>
<p>As PayPal introduced a wide variety of different API products over the years, Angell was able to become familiar with them one at a time as they were released. He spent a good deal of time providing free support to people looking for help with PayPal development on StackOverflow, which led to a seemingly never-ending supply of PayPal-specific client work and eventually a partnership with PayPal that pays him a revenue share based on the volume of transactions processed through their platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;For a long time I was just another web developer that was using the PayPal forums as a way to generate work and prestige for the &#8220;angelleye&#8221; name,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;The vast majority of the work that was coming to me was WordPress / WooCommerce type work where people wanted help getting PayPal working the way they want. My primary business model was to sell websites and custom jobs, and the PayPal revenue share was a nice little bonus on that.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a general developer/user myself, when I would get these jobs I was thinking, oh great, Woo provides premium extensions for Express Checkout, Payments Pro, etc,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just buy those and we&#8217;ll use those in these projects to keep the time/cost down for my client.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I started doing this, though, I quickly saw that while the Woo community builds a great shopping cart, they left much to be desired in the specific area of PayPal payment integration. Their plugins were missing lots of little features PayPal provides that are useful, and the error catching wasn&#8217;t done well, so successful payments could actually be flagged as failures, and other little things like that were just wrong. I found myself spending so much time extending/customizing their plugins that I just decided I needed to build my own. That&#8217;s how PayPal for WooCommerce was born,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-for-woocommerce.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50993"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-for-woocommerce.png?resize=1025%2C331" alt="paypal-for-woocommerce" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50993" /></a></p>
<p>Angell&#8217;s first official WordPress plugin was a success, thanks to the popularity of WooCommerce as well as PayPal&#8217;s <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/payments/" target="_blank">67% market share</a> among payment gateways.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because many others were experiencing the same struggles I was with Woo&#8217;s extensions, it [PayPal for WooCommerce] quickly became popular on its own &#8211; enough that it completely changed my business model,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I am now entirely focused on building tools like this, giving them away for free, and generating as much volume as I can.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-plugins.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50996"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/paypal-plugins.png?resize=245%2C300" alt="paypal-plugins" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-50996" /></a>Angell and his team are starting to play with the premium extension models that WooCommerce and many others use, but he said that PayPal for WooCommerce will always be completely free.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our PayPal IPN for WordPress and our Offers for WooCommerce, though, do have some premium extensions that we&#8217;ll be selling licenses for, and we&#8217;ll continue to build on that as well as maintaining our free stuff,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h3>A Non-Traditional Way of Monetizing a Free WordPress Product</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the WordPress freemium product business model creates revenue by selling commercial licenses and support. With payment gateways it&#8217;s a little different because revenue sharing offers a more lucrative business opportunity. In this scenario it&#8217;s best if the product is free, although it still requires updates, support, and a reputation for reliability.</p>
<p>Angell would not share with us his exact cut from the PayPal partnership program but said it&#8217;s only a fraction of a percent.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any way to see exactly what this one plugin generated for us, but I can tell you that the combination of all the tools we have processed a total of $207 million in 2015,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;PayPal for WooCommerce is by far our most popular tool, but we do have about 10 other tools that are helping with those numbers as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maintaining a payment gateway by staying current with changes to the PayPal API is a ton of work. Add to that the burden of support for 10,000+ active installations, and WooCommerce for PayPal could be a full-time job. The revenue share business model makes supporting this free plugin worthwhile.</p>
<p>&#8220;The model is just nicer for me because I can simply support the product instead of having so many clients breathing down my neck with deadlines,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;I simply make sure I respond quickly to people in the support forums and fix bugs in the plugins whenever necessary as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because of the quality development and our expertise in ensuring PayPal is integrated well, we really don&#8217;t have a lot of issues keeping up with support. Most of the bug reports we get involve conflicts with other plugins, so as long as I make sure our stuff continues to work with new updates of WordPress and WooCommerce we can generally get through our days stress free,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have definitely thought about building similar extensions for other plugins like GravityForms, etc. but we&#8217;re still in growth stages here and aren&#8217;t working with a very big budget,&#8221; Angell said. &#8220;Only myself and one other developer are managing all of these tools right now, and that&#8217;s on top of all the client work we still have and do on a regular basis just because we didn&#8217;t want to kill relationships with good clients.&#8221;</p>
<p>Angell and his team also benefit from keeping PayPal for WooCommerce open source and freely <a href="https://github.com/angelleye/paypal-woocommerce" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a>, where they can receive contributions and bug reports for improvements. Since the business model doesn&#8217;t revolve around selling licenses and limiting the number of sites that can use them, there&#8217;s no need to keep the code locked up.</p>
<p>The model also works out well for the users, who receive a high quality plugin and support for free as opposed to paying <a href="https://www.woothemes.com/products/paypal-pro/" target="_blank">$79 for a single license of PayPal Pro</a> or $199 for up to 25 sites. PayPal for WooCommerce, on the other hand, can be used on an unlimited number of sites for free.</p>

It&#8217;s one of the easiest ways to contribute back to the project without having to touch code. If you&#8217;re interested in helping others in the support forums, check out the¬†<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2016/01/contributor-weekend-support-forums/">first global contributor drive</a> on January 30-31, 2016.</p>
<p>Contributor drives are new initiatives created by the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/">WordPress Community Team</a>. While a number of WordCamps have a day set aside for attendees to contribute back to WordPress, not everyone has one nearby they can attend.¬†The first drive is focused on the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support">Support Team</a> which answers questions in the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support">support forums</a>.</p>
<p>The drives are composed of challenges that take place over the course of a weekend to give people in different time zones an opportunity to participate. On this drive, contributors are challenged to answer 20 support requests in the forums.</p>
<p>While individuals can participate, it&#8217;s a lot more fun to do so as a group. Participants are encouraged to work with people from their local meetup group. If this isn&#8217;t feasible, join the <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/forums/">#forums channel</a> on Slack where moderators will be standing by to provide guidance to new contributors.</p>
<p>WordPress has an amazing world-wide community and if 30 people complete the challenge, 600 threads will be responded too. Initiatives like this are a great idea and an excellent opportunity for new contributors to get their feet wet.</p>
<p>For more details and directions on how to participate, please view the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/20-questions/">guide to contributor weekend</a>.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. Starting today and every Friday, I&#8217;ll share an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn&#8217;t make it into a full post.</p>
<h2>Beyond Imagination by Dustin Filippini</h2>
<p>Dustin Filippini, <span class="st">a web developer based in Milwaukee, WI</span> <a href="http://heropress.com/essays/beyond-imagination/">shared his HeroPress story</a> on how he got involved with WordPress. When Filippini was fired after two years of working in a retail management position, he dedicated all of his resources to learning web design and development in the late 90s and early 2000s.</p>
<p>While the firing was a blow to his self-esteem, it provided him with the motivation to follow his passion. Filippini turned a bad situation into one of the best things that&#8217;s ever happened to him. Filippini&#8217;s story is another example that shows why local WordPress meetups are the cornerstone of the community.</p>
<h2>A/B Testing With WordPress</h2>
<p>There&#8217;s a <a href="https://wpchat.com/t/ab-testing-plugin-or-service-what-do-you-use/1259">great discussion on WPChat.com</a> where folks are sharing information on the services and plugins they use to A/B test sites. The thread includes input from Josh Pollock, who develops <a href="http://ingothq.com/">Ingot</a>, an A/B testing plugin for WordPress.</p>
<h2>Freedom, Speech, and Codes of Conduct</h2>
<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="http://mor10.com/on-freedom-and-speech/">published a great article</a> that dives into the freedom of speech, hate speech, codes of conduct, and the idea of speech as an act. I don&#8217;t understand what so many people have against codes of conduct but I agree with Hendriksen when he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Codes of Conduct are in place to protect everyone‚Äôs¬†rights: They ensure a space in which a civil discourse can take place without anyone resorting to personal attacks and creating an environment that becomes inaccessible or actively hostile to¬†participants or groups. Codes of Conduct ensure open spaces for freedom of expression.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Story Behind the Wapuu Coins at WordCamp US 2015</h2>
<p>For many attendees at WordCamp US, the metal challenge coins distributed by GoDaddy <a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminefox/status/676987883954245633">were a hit</a>.

<h2>Reminder About the WordPress Plugin Directory Tag Policy</h2>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to submit your plugin to the WordPress plugin directory, please review the guidelines regarding the use of tags. In general, plugins are limited to 12 or less and tags should relate to the plugin&#8217;s features.</p>

<h2>Endless Stream of WordPress Positivity</h2>
<p>The WordPress project <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-is-revamping-its-testimonials-page-with-ilovewp-social-media-campaign">recently revamped</a> its <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/testimonials/">testimonials page</a> that features testimonials from people sharing their love of WordPress on social media. Browsing the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ilovewp?src=hash">#ilovewp hashtag</a> on Twitter shows that there&#8217;s a lot to like about WordPress.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ilovewp?src=hash">#ilovewp</a> because of the community. I have found my tribe, full of people who collaborate and love building cool stuff.</p>

<h2>A Look Back at the History of WordPress User Interfaces</h2>
<p>Although it was published in 2014, <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/history-wordpress-ui/">this post by WPExplorer</a> that looks at the history of the WordPress user interface is great reference material. It&#8217;s difficult to install older versions of WordPress to obtain screenshots which is why the post is a treasure trove of information. The user interface has come a long way since its creation in 2003.</p>
<h2>Hot Cocoa/Coffee Wapuu!</h2>
<p>In what will be a traditional part of this series, I&#8217;m going to end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project. As it&#8217;s Winter here in the US, Hot Cocoa/Coffee Wapuu, designed by Michelle Schulp, is one most of us can relate too.</p>

<p><a href="http://arunas.co/" target="_blank">Ar≈´nas Liuiza</a>, like many other WordPress developers, prefers to develop his plugins on GitHub, thanks to the collaborative tools for issue tracking, merging, and pull requests. Hosting and developing open source projects on GitHub is much easier than trying to get any participation from the community via a plugin&#8217;s Subversion repo on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>For these reasons Liuiza decided to create <a href="http://deployer.edwinapp.com/" target="_blank">Deployer</a>, a service that allows plugin developers to publish plugins to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory directly from GitHub, without using Subversion at all. He first presented the app at <a href="http://lithuania.wordcamp.org/" target="_blank">WordCamp Lithuania</a> in September 2015, but hasn&#8217;t yet given it much promotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted to streamline the process of publishing plugins from GitHub to WordPress.org,&#8221; Liuiza said. &#8220;I have more than 10 plugins in the repository, so I want to do things fast and easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last July we covered a similar service called <a href="http://wptavern.com/ship-a-new-app-for-shipping-plugins-from-github-to-wordpress-org" target="_blank">Ship</a>, which offered a hassle free approach to shipping plugins directly from GitHub to WordPress.org. Liuiza, with 10 plugins to maintain, was initially excited about Ship but found there were several drawbacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, Ship required pretty wide access to my GitHub account,&#8221; he said. &#8220;GitHub does not provide granular API access, so I‚Äôd have to grant Ship access to all my GitHub repos, not only the one I wanted to publish from. That includes my private repos.</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, Ship needed my WordPress.org credentials. And because it will need to use them regularly, they could not really hash them and had to store them in plaintext. Again, that would give Ship access to everything in my WordPress.org account. All plugins, all themes, all comments, all translations, etc. Everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>This inspired Liuiza to create Deployer with a new approach that doesn&#8217;t require giving away access and credentials.</p>
<p>&#8220;In comparison to Ship, Deployer takes a quite opposite stance when it comes to requiring access,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Where Ship requests a lot of privileges, Deployer asks for almost none.</p>
<p>&#8220;Deployer asks no privileges on GitHub. Public GitHub repositories can be cloned without any limitations by anyone, so Deployer does that. Deployer would need access to set up a WebHook for itself, but instead of requesting access Deployer provides step by step instructions for user how to set up the Webhook manually,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>
<p>The Deployer service doesn&#8217;t handle any sensitive authentication data for GitHub or WordPress.org. Instead, it requires a more manual setup.</p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of requiring user‚Äôs WordPress.org credentials, Deployer has a dedicated WordPress.org user, deployer,&#8221; Liuiza said. &#8220;The plugin author has to manually add the deployer user to his plugin‚Äôs committer list, thus allowing that user to commit code to plugin‚Äôs SVN repository. This also enhances security, because WordPress.org can identify all the commits, made by the deployer user and roll them back in case there is a breach from Deployer‚Äôs side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pushing a new version of a plugin from GitHub to WordPress.org is as easy as tagging the new version on GitHub. Deployer even handles updates to the readme.txt file and the assets directory.</p>
<p>&#8220;In terms of technology, Deployer is basically a single PHP file, that parses calls from GitHub Webhooks and then executes a bunch of shell commands (mostly git and svn) on a small Linux VPS box,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>
<p>Since launching last year, 34 plugins have been registered with Deployer, although Liuiza said he doesn&#8217;t keep logs on how many developers are using it regularly. He doesn&#8217;t currently have plans to monetize it but is happy to <a href="http://arunas.co/#coffee" target="_blank">accept donations</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless it becomes a drain on my resources (and it does not seem likely at this point) it will always be a free tool,&#8221; Liuiza said.</p>

<p>WordPress.org is getting some love in 2016. In addition to a beautifully redesigned <a href="https://login.wordpress.org/" target="_blank">login page</a>, the <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/testimonials/" target="_blank">testimonials page</a> is in the process of being completely revamped.</p>
<p>The update comes not a moment too soon, as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160121081904/https://wordpress.org/about/testimonials/" target="_blank">old testimonials</a> page included entries dating back to 2003 with what are now rather humorous references to b2 and Moveable Type:</p>
<blockquote><p>I had been an avid b2 user for the last 6 months or so, but then decided to take advantage of WordPress‚Äôs features, commitment to extra development and stable codebase. So far, so good. &#8211; BC</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>From my just under 24 hours of experience with WordPress, I‚Äôm a happy man. This is fantastic code, and it‚Äôs only just getting on its feet! The updates that are forthcoming promise to make this one of the premiere weblog engines on the web today. Good work! I eagerly await your future versions! ‚Äî Aaron Mildenstein</p></blockquote>
<p>Aaron Mildenstein may have been peering through a crystal ball when he wrote that testimonial 13 years ago, as WordPress now powers 25% of the web. The software and the community have changed drastically from those early days when it was still vying for legitimacy. There are now more CMS options than ever, and WordPress is the leader of the pack.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Matt Mullenweg <a href="https://ma.tt/2016/01/testimonials-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">posted</a> a call for users to share what WordPress means to them using the hashtag #ilovewp on WordPress, Twitter, or Facebook.</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of something that you love about WP that would make someone who hasn‚Äôt heard of it, or is on the fence about using it, compelled to try it out,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>
<p>Twitter is filling up with heart-warming snippets of how WordPress has opened up opportunities for people to make a living and be a part of a community that is changing the web:</p>

<p>The most striking change in the testimonials today versus the early ones in 2003 is that WordPress is now much more than the sum of its distinguishing blog features. For many users, WordPress means a chance to make a living while taking care of their families and a chance to connect to a global community of people who believe in open source software.</p>
<p>As for me, I love WordPress because it gives people a voice. It puts the power of publishing into the hands of every day people. I also appreciate that the people behind WordPress, all the way up to the very top, are defenders of free speech and <a href="http://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">advocates of the open web</a>. Even if the technology behind the software makes radical shifts, WordPress&#8217; guiding principles are what make it a publishing platform that will stand the test of time.</p>

<p><a href="https://wooconf.com/" target="_blank">WooConf 2016</a>, a conference devoted entirely to WooCoomerce, will be held in Austin, Texas on April 6-8th. <a href="http://wptavern.com/wooconf-the-first-ever-conference-dedicated-to-woocommerce-deemed-a-success" target="_blank">Recaps from those who attended in 2014</a> are all agreed that this is one conference you don&#8217;t want to miss if you work with WooCommerce. The event attracts a healthy mix of entrepreneurs, developers, designers and consultants. The WooNinjas who build the platform will also be on hand with expert tips and advice. Attendees will be able to book them for 30 minute consultations throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> has been downloaded more than 12 million times and is active on more than a million WordPress sites. The software is currently <a href="http://wptavern.com/woocommerce-dominates-global-e-commerce-platforms-passes-7-million-downloads" target="_blank">dominating global e-commerce</a>, powering roughly 30% of all online stores. WooConf 2016 will be the first WooCommerce event since <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">Automattic acquired WooThemes</a> in May 2015.</p>
<p>More than 30 speakers will be on the schedule, including SocialMedia.org CEO Andy Sernovitz, e-commerce expert David De Boer, and Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg.</p>
<p>Conference organizers are holding a <a href="https://wooconf.com/golden-ticket/?" target="_blank">Golden Ticket contest</a> where participants who share their WooCommerce stories on Instagram have a chance to win a round-trip flight, hotel accommodation, and conference pass. More than <a href="https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/wooconf/" target="_blank">350 posts</a> are already marked with the #WooConf hastag.</p>

<p>The video contest is unearthing a host of diverse ways that WooCommerce is being used around the globe, such as selling educational courses, helping children in India, selling music, and even powering a dog grooming business. If you browse the contest videos, it&#8217;s amazing to see how many different applications people have found for the WooCommerce platform.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re planning to attend the event, don&#8217;t wait to grab your tickets. The first WooConf in 2014 was sold out at 320 attendees and this year&#8217;s event will likely be no exception. <a href="https://wooconf.com/product/wooconf-2016-tickets/" target="_blank">Early bird tickets are on sale</a> for $499 through the end of January. Regular tickets will be sold for $599 until March 1st when the last minute price will go up to $699.</p>

Her proposal and associated mockups like the one below, generated a lot of discussion. However, the project lost steam and major changes to the Add New Post screen were not implemented.</p>

<p>The post editor has undergone <a href="http://www.wpexplorer.com/history-wordpress-ui/">numerous improvements</a> over the years from metaboxes in WordPress 2.0 to oEmbed support in 2.9. Here&#8217;s what the post editor looked like in WordPress 3.0.</p>

<p><a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/michael-arestad"> Michael Arestad</a>, Designer at Automattic, is sparking <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2016/01/11/improving-post-new/">renewed interest</a> to revamp the content editing and creation experience in WordPress. The project is composed of several smaller projects such as, the publishing user experience, automatic saving, the toolbar, metaboxes, and more.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few of us have been talking about getting these projects going for a while so I wanted to see how much interest there is and how many contributors we have to work with. I am by no means leading this as much as doing what I can to get the people interested in some of these projects going on them. I‚Äôll personally be working on some of the longer projects,&#8221; Arestad told the Tavern.</p>
<p>A few people have already committed to parts of the project. <a class="mention" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/karmatosed">Tammie Lister</a> is leading a team focused on improving the Revisions UI while¬†Hugo Baeta is leading the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27159">Toolbar Remix</a> team.</p>
<p>The Revisions UI project is focused on experimenting with alternative interfaces to improve user friendliness with a secondary goal of providing a way for users to quickly switch between revisions. The Toolbar Remix team will audit the toolbar in the editor and determine whether buttons should be rearranged, added, or removed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of these projects will span multiple releases depending on the complexity of implementations and the number of usability tests required. There might be a few small ones that make 4.5,&#8221; Arestad said.</p>
<p>A majority of the projects are in the beginning stages. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to an initiative, contact Arestad on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">SlackHQ</a> or the person leading the project that interests you. You can also <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/design/2016/01/11/improving-post-new/">leave feedback</a> by commenting on the proposal.</p>
<h2>Looking Forward to Change</h2>
<p>I work in the post editor everyday and while it&#8217;s a good experience, I want to experiment with alternative interfaces like the conceptual editor in the screenshot above. Consolidating metaboxes into the visual editor is a refreshing idea that I want to use in the real world to see if it speeds up my workflow.</p>
<p>If I were a betting man, I&#8217;d say the Add New Post screen is the most viewed and used part of the WordPress backend. Any changes to the editor and experience will affect a large number of users as evidenced by <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-removes-the-view-post-and-get-shortlink-buttons-from-the-post-editor">the removal</a> of the View Post and Get Shortlink buttons in WordPress 4.4. However, any change that is implemented will likely be meticulously calculated by the core team.</p>
<p>What changes to the Add New Post screen do you want to see that would improve the way you create content in WordPress?</p>

Since <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/" target="_blank">sitemaps</a> are important for SEO, many WordPress sites already have a plugin installed to create them. The new module in Jetpack will detect if you&#8217;re already using one of the popular sitemap plugins before activating.</p>
<p>Users who prefer their current sitemaps plugin can leave the Jetpack module deactivated. As an alternative, you can remove the extra plugin and simply opt for using the one in Jetpack.</p>
<p>The new Sitemaps module has nothing to configure. It will automatically create the following two sitemaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>A generic sitemap: yoursitename.com/sitemap.xml
<li>A news sitemap: yoursitename.com/news-sitemap.xml
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jetpack-sitemaps.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50860"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/jetpack-sitemaps.png?resize=1025%2C744" alt="jetpack-sitemaps" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50860" /></a></p>
<p>The news sitemap is written specifically for publishers who want to show up in Google News. If you meet Google&#8217;s quality and technical guidelines for news sites, you can <a href="https://support.google.com/news/publisher/answer/40787?hl=en" target="_blank">apply to be included</a>. Upon approval, the search engine will index your site using this sitemap. It displays only posts published in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>Jetpack also includes two filters that allow you to add more post types to the sitemaps, since they are limited in what they display. The generic sitemap includes posts, pages, and the custom post types included in Jetpack. The news sitemap only includes posts. Check out Jetpack&#8217;s <a href="https://jetpack.me/support/sitemaps/" target="_blank">sitemaps documentation</a> for help customizing them.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/social-menu.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50872"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/social-menu.png?resize=300%2C101" alt="social-menu" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-50872" /></a>Version 3.9 of the plugin also includes a new Skype sharing button and a new <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/social-menu/" target="_blank">social menu</a> feature that uses  Genericons. Theme developers who want to include support for a menu that displays links to social networks can simply declare theme support and use a template tag to output the menu.</p>
<p>This version also improves Photon&#8217;s compatibility with WordPress 4.4&#8217;s custom image sizes and the module now works seamlessly on HTTPS sites with no filter required.</p>
<p>Jetpack 3.9 features 20 enhancements and 18 bug fixes. Check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/changelog/" target="_blank">changelog</a> for a full overview.</p>

<p>After nearly eight years in business, <a href="http://themehybrid.com/" target="_blank">Theme Hybrid</a> has released its first commercial plugin. Up until now, all of the club&#8217;s themes and plugins have been free, but Justin Tadlock decided to try something new with the release of <a href="http://themehybrid.com/plugins/theme-designer" target="_blank">Theme Designer</a>, priced at $125 (with support).</p>
<p>The price tag reflects the fact that Theme Designer targets independent theme authors, a very small niche demographic. The plugin is a theme portfolio manager with meta fields that cater to displaying theme data. It is the first of its kind and goes far beyond a traditional portfolio plugin to pull in data from WordPress.org, such as ratings, active installs, and downloads.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/theme-designer.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50840"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/theme-designer.png?resize=1025%2C684" alt="theme-designer" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50840" /></a></p>
<p>I spoke with Tadlock to find out why he decided to make the plunge into commercial plugin development after nearly a decade of creating free products and charging for support.</p>
<p>&#8220;From my observations, the larger WP ecosystem has changed over the years,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;When I first began Theme Hybrid, people were more willing to pay for support and less willing to pay for an entire theme/plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Commercial plugins were pretty much nonexistent at the time. Today, it&#8217;s a much different picture. Essentially, it&#8217;s a move that I think makes sense for my site as a business.</p>
<p>He also said that, given the plugin&#8217;s limited audience, &#8220;There&#8217;s a finite number of people who would ever buy it. I couldn&#8217;t justify spending the development time on this as a free plugin.&#8221;</p>
<h3>&#8220;Plugin development is where the commercial space is moving.&#8221;</h3>
<p>Tadlock, a co-author on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Professional-WordPress-Plugin-Development-Williams/dp/0470916222/" target="_blank">Professional WordPress Plugin Development</a>, is no stranger to the plugin space, but has always pursued other avenues of monetization (i.e. support and theme reviews.)</p>
<p>&#8220;Plugin development is where the commercial space is moving,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The theme market is saturated, and there&#8217;s only so much you can do with a theme. There&#8217;s still room to innovate with themes beyond the &#8216;slider + 3 boxes + 3 boxes&#8217; design, but that&#8217;s not my primary focus right now. Plugins allow me to explore ideas that I&#8217;d never be able to explore with themes,&#8221; Tadlock said.</p>
<p>His next product will be aimed directly at plugin developers with a good deal of crossover on features from Theme Designer.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll share much of the same UI,&#8221; Tadlock said. &#8220;The WordPress.org Plugins API integration should be a little deeper. Plugin devs have extra info they can add with their <code>readme.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve still got a bunch of research left though. With Theme Designer, I looked at all the major theme businesses like StudioPress, WooThemes, ThemeForest, and many more. So, I&#8217;ll need to do the same for plugins,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>With hundreds, or perhaps thousands of theme sellers out there, it&#8217;s surprising that the WordPress product space doesn&#8217;t already have more tools for showcasing their work. The theme market has long since matured to the point of sellers needing their own specialized tools. Every shop seems to end up building or adapting its own solution in-house. Tadlock is hoping that introducing commercial plugins like Theme Designer will expand Theme Hybrid&#8217;s user base.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the long run, it should bring in a wider audience of users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One thing I&#8217;ve noticed over the past couple of years is that more people have already been signing up for plugin support, so the site&#8217;s audience is already in a transitioning phase.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tadlock still plans to build free plugins and themes in addition to the new commercial offerings. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that changing any time soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll still build free plugins and themes, so that&#8217;s not changing.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mason James hired his first contractor and launched <a href="http://www.valet.io/" target="_blank">WP Valet</a> in 2012, scaling up wasn&#8217;t part of his master plan. He knew he couldn&#8217;t do it alone but couldn&#8217;t imagine having more than a small team. His first contractor, Kim Lipari, became a partner and helped to bring in more customer requests than they knew how to handle. Four years later, the team is now 10 employees and 6 full-time contractors, and the company is hiring aggressively to fill more positions.</p>
<p>Today WP Valet is dropping the &#8220;WP&#8221; from its name and <a href="http://www.valet.io/we-are-valet/" target="_blank">rebranding as Valet</a>. The company started out providing monthly professional services and support for WordPress website owners, but expanded to take on more client work after acquiring a local design agency.</p>
<p>&#8220;In 2014, EasilyAmused merged with us and we acqui-hired their team,&#8221; James said. &#8220;James Tryon came on board as our Creative Director to continue leading this team. This made a huge difference as it doubled our team size and allowed us to provide a much higher level of design and development.&#8221;</p>
<p>The rebranding announced today is a reflection of Valet&#8217;s expanded services. &#8220;We&#8217;re still 100% built on and using WordPress and think it&#8217;ll be an integral part of websites for a long, long time to come,&#8221; James said. &#8220;But we want to expand our customer reach as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our services are centered around best practices that are applicable to all websites &#8211; regardless of their platform. And finally, our customer needs include branding, design, strategy, and a ton of other things that don&#8217;t specifically require WordPress. The new Valet brand provides us room to have these discussions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Growing the team to take on more custom development, in addition to monthly website support services, has paid off for Valet, which is now a multimillion dollar company.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen steady growth since we started in 2012,&#8221; James said. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud to be a grassroots startup with no funding or investors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our revenue is split pretty evenly between monthly support and individual custom development/design projects. Part of our rebranding goals was to line up our presentation with what we really do today.</p>
<p>&#8220;While migrations made up a third of our revenue in the first year, it now accounts for less than an eighth! Overall our revenue is in the millions, though closer to 10M than to 100M. Year-over-year revenue growth increased about 45% in 2015.&#8221;</p>
<h3>Raising the Bar on Support</h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-valet-team.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-50825"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-valet-team.jpg?resize=920%2C421" alt="wp-valet-team" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50825" /></a></p>
<p>As Valet continues to scale its support services team, James is on a mission to change the WordPress support niche. When the company was first starting out, they became well known for handling migrations and maintenance.</p>
<p>&#8220;We reached out to a couple of companies and asked if we could do some migrations for them,&#8221; James said. &#8220;We wanted to better understand their setup and expectations. This resonated well with a few of those companies and we ended up doing thousands of migrations, growing the team to four people who exclusively handled migrations on a day-to-day basis.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, James never aimed for WP Valet to be a migrations and maintenance company and is determined to reshape customer thinking about monthly support.</p>
<p>&#8220;The truth is, WP Valet was founded on the idea of ongoing professional services,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was never meant to be specific to migrations or maintenance. The real passion was to make sure website owners had all the strategy, insights, and support they needed to operate in the month-to-month requirements of running a business.&#8221;</p>
<p>James is hoping to change the support niche so as not to perpetuate the idea of &#8220;maintenance&#8221; to customers. He said that he doesn&#8217;t like the word and avoids it on purpose.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most of our customers are not &#8216;brochure sites&#8217; with WordPress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re businesses. They rely on their sites to help create revenue.</p>
<p>&#8220;I frequently tell our potential clients, <em>&#8216;Maintenance is fine for your dishwasher, but your business should always be pursuing growth!&#8217;</em> We do this by creating real, targeted metrics for our clients across several key areas of site performance and provide them with the ability to see these stats at any time. More than that, we work pro-actively to make sure key areas like site speed and traffic are improving without the client needing to open a specific request.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Valet team plans to focus on performance benchmarking this year while continuing to support the monthly needs of their customers. According to James, 50% of their revenue still comes from the regular monthly support plans. Balancing the rapid growth of the support team while managing projects as a full service agency is a delicate balancing act.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growth and scaling are absolutely terrifying,&#8221; James said. &#8220;When people ask me about how fast we scale, I respond with something along the lines of &#8216;as much as we can without me lying in the fetal position under the piano in the den.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found that it&#8217;s more natural for me to identify and take action on failure then it is to measure success,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Finding success can leave me with a &#8216;now what?&#8217; feeling so I&#8217;m learning to enjoy the moments and victories on the ride.&#8221;</p>

Similar to <a href="https://vaultpress.com/">VaultPress</a>, Stash Live is a service that will enable users to perform real-time backups.</p>
<p>Both the database and files will be streamed to the service where you can create a snapshot. The snapshot includes, a site&#8217;s database, files, plugins, and themes. Users will be able to download the .ZIP file or keep it on Stash Live and use it as an off-site backup storage location.</p>
<p>In addition to performing real-time backups, Stash Live offloads the processing power used to create them making it friendly to shared webhosting environments. BackupBuddy 7.0 is currently in the beta testing phase that iThemes plans to release soon. Customers with an active subscription will receive access to the service for free.</p>

<p>There are at least <a href="https://wordpress.org/about/philosophy/">three major releases</a> of WordPress per year where users can expect new features and major bug fixes about every four months. While this is great for users, some companies, plugin, and theme developers are struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>We recently received the following email from a reader concerned with WordPress&#8217; release strategy:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the pace of WordPress releases grows, plugin and theme developers have to constantly update their products. This is leading to a real and growing problem among WordPress site owners and companies like mine that handle website maintenance and updating.</p>
<p>This pace is leading to an almost daily need to fix problems, caused by these updates. Plugin updates tend to break things, even though we primarily use professional, paid plugins for the idea of support and generally better quality products.</p>
<p>I get that it&#8217;s important to patch security issues, but we&#8217;re also seeing a lot of new functionality, moving plugins into core, and other changes. These cause theme developers to push out updates with great frequency and they make mistakes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m worried that the pace of core updates is driving the larger ecosystem toward failure. Everyone is scrambling to keep things patched, then new conflicts arise and things break down. The person on the end &#8216;companies maintaining their sites, responsibly, or services like mine&#8217; face a constant flow of updates, then testing, then trying to fix things that have broken.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt Mullenweg, Co-founder of the WordPress open source software project, specifically addressed this issue during the Q&amp;A session of the 2015 State of the Word at WordCamp US. Mika Epstein, who voluntarily reviews and approves plugins for the WordPress plugin directory, voiced the concerns shared by developers who are struggling to keep up.</p>
<p>With the myriad of technologies developers have to learn, including the REST API and JavaScript, Epstein asked Mullenweg if WordPress is moving too fast and if the number of releases per year should decrease by one.</p>
<div class="embed-wrap"></div>
<p>Mullenweg answered the question by saying improvements can be made to the plugin directory so that users can share the burden in the testing process. He also said that the speed of WordPress development will increase instead of decrease. Meanwhile, the development team will continue to release three major versions per year.</p>
<p>He then describes a future where developers may be able to lessen their support burden by using the REST API that&#8217;s slated for WordPress 4.5. He also cites how large webhosting companies, such as Bluehost, have automatically upgraded most of the WordPress sites on their network to the latest stable version. Mullenweg ends his response by apologizing to those who feel WordPress is moving too fast but says its worked so far.</p>
<h2>How Do You Keep Up With WordPress?</h2>
<p>While we do a great job of keeping users and developers informed, plugin and theme authors should subscribe to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/plugins/">Make Plugins</a> and <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/themes/">Make Themes</a> sites respectively. Anyone involved with maintaining WordPress sites should subscribe to the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/core/">Make Core</a> site where important information related to core is published.</p>
<p>We know that the release strategy isn&#8217;t going to change so whether you&#8217;re a developer or someone in charge of maintaining sites, how are you keeping up with WordPress?</p>

<p>Last year Jenny Wong and Aaron Jorbin challenged the WordPress community to <a href="http://wptavern.com/venturing-outside-the-bubble-wordpress-community-members-attend-php-uk-2015-conference" target="_blank">venture outside the WordPress bubble</a> after speaking at PHP UK 2015. Both were enriched by the experience of connecting across technology communities and challenging others&#8217; expectations of WordPress.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in the Tampa area and looking to branch out to some non-WordCamp conferences, the first annual <a href="http://www.joomladayflorida.com/" target="_blank">JoomlaDay Florida</a> is happening on February 27th, 2016. WordPress developers in Florida have the opportunity to connect with the Joomla community at the invitation of the organizers. The event website includes a page with a <a href="http://www.joomladayflorida.com/about-joomladay-florida/wordpress-developers" target="_blank">special invitation to WordPress developers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first annual JoomlaDay Florida is not only for Joomla enthusiasts, WordPress developers will also find the conference educational and informative.

<p><a href="http://blog.glotpress.org/2016/01/19/glotpress-1-0-bunsen-honeydew/" target="_blank">GlotPress 1.0</a> ‚ÄúBunsen Honeydew‚Äù was released yesterday. In June 2015, Andrew Nacin began the work of transforming GlotPress into a plugin with a <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/commit/d9d47271c6ce0c8e3d927088853ac47c1d100561" target="_blank">first pass</a> that switched it from using the BackPress external to a WordPress install. Dominik Schilling led the development on GitHub, which included <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/compare/d9d47271...d0a12dc035" target="_blank">352 commits</a> and fixes for <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.0+is%3Aissue" target="_blank">70 issues</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;For the first version the goal was to change as little as possible to get it working well,&#8221; Schilling said in the release announcement. &#8220;But still we had to remove some things in favor of WordPress&#8217; API system.&#8221;</p>
<p>Version 1.0 includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>It‚Äôs a plugin!</li>
<li>WP-CLI support</li>
<li>Integrated with WordPress‚Äô user system</li>
<li>Easy installation through the WordPress.org plugin directory</li>
<li>Multisite support</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a customized GlotPress install and you want to switch to the new WordPress plugin, you will want to review the plugin&#8217;s wiki to take stock of the <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/1.1-Breaking-Changes" target="_blank">breaking changes</a>. Contributors have also written a guide to <a href="https://github.com/deliciousbrains/GlotPress/wiki/1.2-Converting-Plugins" target="_blank">converting plugins</a> for the standalone version to use the WordPress plugin infrastructure.</p>
<p>Having GlotPress available as a plugin makes it much easier to use and update. The standalone version had a more complicated installation and configuration process, but it was worth it for the collaboration capabilities that it offered. All this can now be added to any WordPress site with the click of a button.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glotpress/" target="_blank">GlotPress plugin</a> is now available for download on WordPress.org and includes a beautiful newly designed plugin icon and banner. An <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP/wiki/2.-Branding-and-Logos" target="_blank">official branding guide</a> is also available thanks to Hugo Baeta and other contributors. You can follow the plugin&#8217;s development and <a href="https://github.com/GlotPress/GlotPress-WP" target="_blank">contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The makers of GitLab are attempting to capitalize on the current situation at GitHub where open source project maintainers have publicized their frustrations with issue management. Last week, project maintainers <a href="http://wptavern.com/open-source-project-maintainers-confront-github-with-open-letter-on-issue-management" target="_blank">published a letter called &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221;</a> that outlines their concerns and the solutions they hope to see implemented.</p>
<p>GitHub has not officially responded to these concerns, apart from a new Director of Community dropping <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10905338" target="_blank">a note on Hacker News</a> to recognize the feedback with a disclaimer that he is &#8220;still figuring out how GitHub fits together as an organization but&#8230; happy to take a look into these issues and ensure they are considered in how future work is planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitLab, on the other hand, wasted no time in addressing the group&#8217;s concerns in a <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/2016/01/15/making-gitlab-better-for-large-open-source-projects/" target="_blank">post</a> that begins, &#8220;Dear open source maintainers:&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>We want GitLab to be the best place for any software project, whether open source or not, whether big or small.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">The letter of GitHub‚Äôs open source community</a> is clearly not addressed to us, but we‚Äôre thinking a lot about the issues that were mentioned in it. We see many of these things happening and have been working on them for a long time, not in the least because we develop on <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues" target="_blank">a busy public issue tracker</a> ourselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>GitLab, which already allows project maintainers to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/doc/customization/issue_and_merge_request_template.md" target="_blank">set a template for an issue and for merge requests</a>, is planning on adding <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/issues/101" target="_blank">multiple templates</a>, and is strongly considering the suggestion of <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8988" target="_blank">custom fields</a>. A new <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/9088" target="_blank">issue</a> has been created to track discussion and progress on the possibility of using a new_issue.md file for templates.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/Jobvo" target="_blank">Job van der Voort</a>, VP of Product at GitLab, addressed every concern mentioned in the open letter to GitHub. He highlighted the fact that<br />
GitLab already has a voting system that transforms +1s into votes and noted plans for improving the placement of CONTRIBUTING.md at the top of issues screens.</p>
<p>Van der Voort also created a new issue for the GitLab Community Edition called &#8220;<a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/8938" target="_blank">Making GitLab the best place for big open source projects</a>.&#8221; This issue is now home to a long list of of frustrations and suggestions that were included in the original letter to GitHub. Van der Voort and contributors have responded to every single point and have created new issues for improving GitLab where necessary.</p>
<p>After just four days, the <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a> letter has received more than 1,100 signatures from open source project maintainers. Although the authors have received no official response from GitHub, the letter has sparked some healthy discussions around the web about how code hosting services can better serve their open source communities.</p>
<p>Both GitHub and GitLab have built their reputations and business on supporting open source software, <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/08/github-data-shows-changing-software-landscape/" target="_blank">which has now become mainstream</a> and more easily adopted by enterprises. Open source software runs the world. No code hosting site that aims to be the leader can afford to ignore the requests of open source project maintainers for long.</p>

<p>Last month, one of my VPS servers suffered a catastrophic disk failure, taking down several personal websites that my wife and I manage. All of our WordPress content is on a separate database server, so the main content is still intact. I&#8217;ve also been able to extract¬†a <em>few</em> things from a raw image of the damaged drive. ¬†But there were some things (site-specific plugins, child-themes, media content, utility scripts, my email archives) which are likely gone for good, or that will at least be painful to put back into place (uploaded images, etc.).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not much use crying over spilt milk, though, so I at least saw this as an opportunity to freshen up and improve upon my previous server configuration. In its previous incarnation, I had been running Apache workers, and PHP-FPM (PHP 5.6.x). But I also had some web experiments in Nodejs, which I had to run on a non-standard port, so as to not conflict with Apache. Since I was starting from scratch anyways, I&#8217;ve decided to put HAProxy in front of everything, so that I can internally run multiple web servers, and just proxy to them transparently. And while I was at it, I&#8217;ve been hearing a lot of good things about the speed improvements in PHP 7, so I figured I&#8217;d upgrade that, as well.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t go into the nitty-gritty details of my install (especially since I&#8217;m not finished yet), but I did want to let others know about a problem I&#8217;ve run into: There is a new development build of the php-ssh2 extension for PHP 7, but it is not quite complete yet. Many things do work, but unfortunately, all of the functions which rely on the ability to use the <code>stat()</code> call are broken at this time. This includes other file-checking functions such as <code>is_dir()</code>, and <code>is_file()</code>, <code>file_exists()</code>. In WordPress, if you are using the SSH2 filesystem class (rather than FTP or FTPS), this will prevent you from using the built-in plugin and theme installers, or any of the automatic upgrade functionality.</p>
<p>After digging around in the php-ssh2 extension source code for a while and comparing to a previous version, I was unable to find the problem myself. My C programming is too rusty, and I just don&#8217;t have the time to start learning PHP and libssh2 internals from scratch. But, I did <a href="https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=71376">file a bug on the PHP Bugtracker</a>, and the author of the PHP 7 port of the php-ssh2 extension has said that he is working on a fix. So keep an out out for an update on that.</p>
<p>Just as a side-note, using fstat() on a filehandle opened on an ssh2.sftp file resource, or using the ssh2_sftp_stat() call do work. But that doesn&#8217;t help with the is_dir() and is_file() calls which are failing in the class-wp-filesystem-ssh2.php code. Those functions rely on the PHP internal ssh2.sftp stream wrappers.</p>
<p>Postscript: I know plenty of people will say, &#8220;You should have had backups!&#8221; or even, &#8220;Your VPS host must suck for not having backups!&#8221;. The former is absolutely true &#8212; I should have done better at backing up some of the things that I did not have backups for. The VPS host is not really to blame. I had gotten a disk size upgrade, and I actually had an opportunity to request a snapshot of my system before I ran the upgrade process to extend my disk. But because I had run it successfully on another server without incident, I got careless. And after the upgrade, the system seemed to run fine for about three weeks before any problems surfaced.</p>

The results from this year&#8217;s survey show two trends.</p>
<p>First, average monthly spending increased sharply from last year. WPShout attributes the increase to either people spending more money on hosting or a different demographic taking the survey. Second, EIG owned hosts as a group scored poorly across the board, especially A Small Orange which was acquired in 2012.</p>

<p>A Small Orange received accolades in <a href="http://wpshout.com/wordpress-hosting-review-2014-results/">the 2014 survey</a> but multiple outages in 2015 increased customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s results improved over last year but it still scores below other companies. In particular, customers commented that its managed WordPress offering is superior to its other hosting options.</p>

<p>Specialized webhosts continued their streak of doing well in the survey. Among the hosts that scored well across the board are Flywheel, Digital Ocean, Kinsta, and WP Engine.</p>

<p>A zealous cadre of open source project maintainers is hoping to inspire change at GitHub by publicizing their complaints regarding issue management. After pursuing official channels without receiving a response, the group&#8217;s members say that they are frustrated by a lack of communication:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those of us who run some of the most popular projects on GitHub feel completely ignored by you. We‚Äôve gone through the only support channel that you have given us either to receive an empty response or even no response at all. We have no visibility into what has happened with our requests, or whether GitHub is working on them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Authors of the &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/dear-github/" target="_blank">Dear GitHub</a>&#8221; repository, which has no public members, collectively penned <a href="https://github.com/dear-github/dear-github" target="_blank">an earnest letter</a> that outlines three critical problems they perceive with the way issues currently work.</p>
<p>The first problem the group states is a lack of features for GitHub issues, and they propose a simple solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issues are often filed missing crucial information like reproduction steps or version tested. We‚Äôd like issues to gain custom fields, along with a mechanism (such as a mandatory issue template, perhaps powered by a newissue.md in root as a likely-simple solution) for ensuring they are filled out in every issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>The group is also calling for GitHub to create a &#8220;first-class voting system&#8221; that would declutter the ubiquitous &#8220;+1&#8243;&#8216;s that litter nearly every popular project&#8217;s issues queue. They recognize the +1s as important feedback but demand a better UI to organize this information:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issues often accumulate content-less ‚Äú+1‚Äù comments which serve only to spam the maintainers and any others subscribed to the issue. These +1s serve a valuable function in letting maintainers know how widespread an issue is, but their drawbacks are too great. We‚Äôd like issues to gain a first-class voting system, and for content-less comments like ‚Äú+1‚Äù or ‚Äú:+1:‚Äù or ‚Äúme too‚Äù to trigger a warning and instructions on how to use the voting mechanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The third issue directly impacts the open source workflow, which becomes inefficient when issues and requests are improperly submitted. The proposed solution streamlines important information that guides users toward submitting meaningful contributions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Issues and pull requests are often created without any adherence to the CONTRIBUTING.md contribution guidelines, due to the inconspicuous nature of the ‚Äúguidelines for contributing‚Äù link when creating an issue and the fact that it often contains a lot of information that isn‚Äôt relevant to opening issues (such as information about hacking on the project). Maintainers should be able to configure a file in the repo (interpreted as GFM) to be displayed at the top of the new issue / PR page instead of that link. Maintainers can choose to inline content there and / or link to other pages as appropriate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Authors of the letter have waited years for progress on these issues. The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oGsg02jS-PnlIMJ3OlWIOEmhtG-udTwuDz_vsQPBHKs/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true" target="_blank">600+ project maintainers who have signed the document</a> are incapable of making these changes themselves, since GitHub&#8217;s infrastructure is not open source.</p>
<h3>GitHub&#8217;s Paying Customers Don&#8217;t Share the Same Problems as Open Source Project Maintainers</h3>
<p>With more than <a href="https://github.com/about/press" target="_blank">12 million people collaborating across 31 million repositories</a> as of January 2015, GitHub is home to the largest collection of code on the planet. Its emphasis on &#8220;social coding&#8221; and free hosting for public projects has made GitHub the defacto place to make code available for collaboration. As a result, many free users often forget that it&#8217;s the <a href="https://enterprise.github.com/home" target="_blank">GitHub Enterprise</a> customers who keep the lights on at the company.</p>
<p>Julian Dunn, a product manager at <a href="http://www.chef.io/" target="_blank">Chef</a>, wrote <a href="http://www.juliandunn.net/2016/01/14/dear-dear-github-from-your-local-friendly-product-person/" target="_blank">a response to the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter</a>. He contends that GitHub, unless forced by heated press coverage, isn&#8217;t likely to address these concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were the product manager for GitHub, the answer to your requests would probably be &#8216;no,'&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;That‚Äôs not because I think your feature requests aren‚Äôt legitimate. It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt impact paying customers very highly. And as a company whose developers have to eat, GitHub is probably going to prioritize those customers first.&#8221;</p>
<p>His reasoning is that the issue management problems that plague open source communities don&#8217;t affect GitHub&#8217;s bread and butter to the same degree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paying customers use private repositories and/or GitHub Enterprise, and the wild[er]-west aspects of an open-source ecosystem simply don‚Äôt exist inside a company,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;You‚Äôre unlikely to see +1-DDoS-type behavior inside private repos, for example.&#8221;</p>
<p>GitHub has yet to officially address the &#8220;Dear GitHub&#8221; letter. With a growing list of more than 600 maintainers of popular open source projects signing the document, it will soon be in the company&#8217;s best interest to communicate a response. Authors of the letter are hoping the company will choose to act in support of its open source community to solve the unique challenges that project maintainers contend with when hosting on GitHub.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an open source project maintainer, is this a letter you would sign? Does the current way that GitHub issues are structured satisfy the needs of your project and its users? Would the proposed solutions make a difference for your project?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.drupal.org/">Drupal</a>, the open source CMS founded by Dries Buytaert on December 29th, 2000, <a href="http://buytaert.net/drupal-15-years-old-and-still-gaining-momentum">is 15 years old</a>. Drupal version 1.0.0 was released on January 15th, 2001, &#8220;The early decisions to open-source Drupal and use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL license</a> set the cornerstone principles for how our community shares with one another and builds upon each other&#8217;s achievements to this day,&#8221; Buytaert said.</p>
<p>You might be wondering why a site devoted to WordPress is publishing a story about a competing CMS&#8217; birthday. The fact is, Drupal, Joomla and WordPress are more complimentary than they are competitors. Each is open source, licensed under the GPL, and is composed of code submitted by thousands of volunteers located across the world. All three projects make up a combined total of 37 years of experience.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drupal &#8211; 15 Years Old</li>
<li>WordPress &#8211; 12 Years Old</li>
<li>Joomla &#8211; 10 Years Old</li>
</ul>
<p>When Buytaert founded Drupal, many of the social networking services and browsers we enjoy today didn&#8217;t exist:</p>
<blockquote><p>Chrome, Firefox, and Safari didn&#8217;t exist yet; most people used Netscape, Opera or Internet Explorer. New ideas for sharing and exchanging content such as &#8216;public diaries&#8217; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS">RSS</a> had yet to gain widespread acceptance and Drupal was among the first to support those. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Wikipedia">Wikipedia was launched on the same day as Drupal</a> and sparked the rise of user-generated content. Facebook and Twitter didn&#8217;t exist until 4-5 years later</p></blockquote>
<p>He describes many of the things Drupal got right like hooks and modules. There are some things the project got wrong such as adding support for OpenID which never gained widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Near the end of his post, Buytaert reaffirms his commitment through the Drupal project to protect the privacy, serendipity and freedom of the web we enjoy, &#8220;As the web evolves from a luxury to a basic human right, it&#8217;s important that we treat it that way. To increase our impact, we have to continue to make Drupal easier to use. I&#8217;d love to help <a href="http://buytaert.net/winning-back-the-open-web">build a world where people&#8217;s privacy is safe</a> and Drupal is more approachable.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the <a href="https://videopress.com/v/cmA03MuQ">State of the Word</a> at WordCamp US last year, Matt Mullenweg announced a similar role for WordPress. At the 46:58 mark, Mullenweg discusses WordPress&#8217; APIs being the key to an open web.</p>
<p></p>
<p>At a time when web services are <a href="http://thenextweb.com/twitter/2012/06/30/developers-bracing-themselves-for-twitter-api-retrictions-call-todays-post-ominous/#gref">restricting their APIs</a> to third-party developers, WordPress which is used across 25% of the web with open APIs can help reverse the trend, &#8220;I think that we can use this opening up, especially switching to API driven development to open up more of the web. When you think about what open source looks like, when the code being available isn&#8217;t the most important thing, when we&#8217;re interacting across multiple devices, the APIs become just as important as the code itself being open,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>
<p>Last but not least, check out this interview where Mullenweg and Buytaert share the same stage in 2011 at an event called <a href="http://www.schipulcon.com/">Schipulcon</a>. In the interview, the duo discuss open source software and their experience managing open source projects. One of the key takeaways from the interview is Buytaert&#8217;s response when asked, how WordPress&#8217; existence benefits Drupal, &#8220;If WordPress wins, Drupal wins, because it means open source wins.&#8221;</p>
<div class="embed-wrap"></div>
<p>Like Joomla and WordPress, Drupal is a champion of open source. Its existence and continued success should be celebrated. I hope you&#8217;ll join us by wishing the Drupal project a happy birthday!</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s what Story Lines looks like on the frontend of the Tavern test site. The colors are bold and grab the reader&#8217;s attention.</p>

<p>Story Lines doesn&#8217;t have a settings panel to configure its design, &#8220;That‚Äôs one of the things I‚Äôm still learning about this whole process, is to give people complete control of how it looks. I hope to have something like that for the next version,&#8221; Martella told the Tavern.</p>
<p>If you want to change the design of Story Lines, Martella suggests editing the <strong>story-lines</strong>, <strong>.story-lines</strong>, and <strong>.title classes</strong> with the caveat that you may have to use the <strong>!important </strong>declaration. You should save these changes to a child theme so they&#8217;re not lost when you update the plugin. The list items use the same font as the active theme.</p>
<p>Martella has a background in journalism and is the sports editor for <a href="http://www.dailytexanonline.com/">The Daily Texan</a>. While journalism is his first passion, he&#8217;s slowly transitioning to the web development world by creating themes and plugins for WordPress:</p>
<blockquote><p>I‚Äôve been trying to figure out a niche for myself in the WordPress development world and I‚Äôm starting to think it might be creating themes and plugins that replicate what people see on the New York Times or other top newspaper websites for others to use on their sites.</p>
<p>My first plugin, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jm-breaking-news/">JM Breaking News</a>, and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/giornalismo">Giornalismo</a> theme I created are also examples of that. So really, I‚Äôm just trying to explore the niche where web development and journalism collide and WordPress is the tool I‚Äôm using to do just that.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two features I&#8217;d like to see added in a future release. The first, is the ability to rearrange highlights with a drag-and-drop interface. The second, is a way to add a URL which links to an anchor point in the article so readers can visit specific parts of a story.</p>
<p>I tested Story Lines on WordPress 4.5 alpha and it works as expected. It&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/story-lines/">available for free</a> from the WordPress plugin directory.</p>

The free service allows Envato customers to back up their purchased files. Upvato takes a complete backup of the screenshots, descriptions, titles, and author information. In the event that an item is removed from Envato, customers who have uploaded their files to Upvato have a complete backup.</p>
<p>Freddy Lundekvam, owner of Norway-based <a href="http://www.logik.no/" target="_blank">Logik Web Studios</a>, said that he was inspired to create Upvato after losing purchased files due to the fact that Envato &#8220;<a href="https://help.market.envato.com/hc/en-us/articles/202500244-The-Item-Has-Been-Removed" target="_blank">does not guarantee ongoing availability of items</a> after the initial download.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I‚Äôm a heavy user of Themeforest,&#8221; Lundekvam said. &#8220;I‚Äôm a full time programmer who doesn‚Äôt know much about design, and I‚Äôm especially a huge fan of the admin templates and own 15+ of them. In total, amongst all the marketplaces I‚Äôve bought quite a few items. Having purchased many files, I quickly learned about Envato‚Äôs right to take down and remove any file at their or the author&#8217;s sole discretion without any warning. I personally have lost 10 files because of this policy, and I find it quite annoying to lose files.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lundekvam used to back up his files to Dropbox but found it frustrating to sort through his library without much information and no way to look them up after they disappeared from Envato. He teamed up with a colleague who is a designer and created Upvato as a solution to this problem. In addition to storing the file you purchased, Upvato also stores the screenshots, file descriptions, comments, and includes versioning &#8211; allowing you access to any version that has been uploaded.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upvato-backup.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50616"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/upvato-backup.png?resize=908%2C615" alt="upvato-backup" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50616" /></a></p>
<p>Users can back up an unlimited number of files and there&#8217;s no limit on the file size. Upvato creators are also committed to keeping the service free, according to the statement on their website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upvato is and will always fee a completely free service. We strongly believe that this is something that should be a part of Envato from day one and don&#8217;t agree with their policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>The service uses the Envato API to allow users to back up all of their files automatically. Files can also be uploaded manually into your Upvato account.</p>
<h3>Envato&#8217;s Response to the New Upvato Backup Service</h3>
<p>While Envato does not officially endorse Upvato, the company encourages users to find a backup solution. Venessa Paech, Envato PR Manager, gave WP Tavern the following statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>Envato buyers use a variety of methods for managing their purchases. Whatever service they use, whether Dropbox or a service like Upvato, we always encourage people to back up their digital assets. </p>
<p>Envato Market is an active marketplace with thousands of sellers and millions of items. While we offer a downloads section on every account, our focus is less on post-purchase asset management, and more on discovering and purchasing wonderful digital goods that solve creative challenges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Essentially, after the purchase has been made, Envato doesn&#8217;t find any conflict in users choosing Upvato as a backup solution. The company is unlikely to change its policy about not guaranteeing files indefinitely, as it needs to account for all kinds of circumstances including copyright complaints and technical problems. Upvato&#8217;s free backup solution may reduce the number of Envato customers who are negatively impacted when files are removed without notice.</p>
<h3>&#8220;Storage Space is Cheap&#8221; and Upvato Doesn&#8217;t Plan to Monetize</h3>
<p>I asked Lundekvam how he&#8217;s funding the enormous amount of space required to store files for Envato customers. &#8220;Storage space is cheap these days &#8211; hosting 10 TB of data in an Amazon Glacier is merely $7 a month,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I also take benefit from the automated uploads.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you connect your Envato account and back up the item, then only one file for that item will be used for all users who have the same file (Verified purchased with Envato). Every time you try to download a backup of the file from Envato, we check if the exact same file already exists amongst the items available files. If it does, it‚Äôs not stored. Instead, you use the same file that already exist in the system,&#8221; Lundekvam said.</p>
<p>Despite having created a service that solves a real problem for potentially thousands of customers, Lundekvam said he&#8217;s not seeking a revenue model to fund his efforts. For now, the site exists to solve a problem he encountered that also affects many other Envato customers. Monetization isn&#8217;t a priority for him at this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Currently that‚Äôs not the plan,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Running such a site isn‚Äôt all that expensive. For now, we just wanted to make something cool and useful that people might want and need.&#8221;</p>

<p>Today Human Made released its new <a href="https://hmn.md/wordpress-rest-api-white-paper/" target="_blank">WordPress REST API Whitepaper</a>, an in-depth guide to how the API is changing the way developers interact with WordPress. The publication was written for a diverse audience, including developers, agencies, project managers, and publishers. It includes a technical breakdown of how the REST API works, along with an overview of the benefits and challenges for teams that take on API-driven projects.</p>
<p>The whitepaper is called &#8220;Talking to 25% of the Web,&#8221; but the title may soon need to be updated as <a href="http://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management/all" target="_blank">WordPress usage in mid-January is 25.7%</a> and is forecasted to climb past 26% in Q1. It is a collaborative publication authored by the team at Human Made, which includes several lead contributors on the WP REST API team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hmn.md/wordpress-rest-api-white-paper/" target="_blank">overview for the whitepaper</a> summarizes the different topics you&#8217;ll find within the content:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduces you to the headless CMS</li>
<li>Introduces you to REST</li>
<li>Provides a technical overview of the WordPress REST API</li>
<li>Explores some of the benefits of using the REST API in your project</li>
<li>Talks about some of the ways that the REST API will change WordPress development</li>
<li>Discusses some of the challenges that you may encounter in your REST API project</li>
</ul>
<p>The 44-page guide also includes case studies of companies already using the WP REST API and a list of important resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://hmn.md/wordpress-rest-api-white-paper/" target="_blank">Talking to 25% of the Web</a>&#8221; is an excellent free resource that should be required reading for anyone using WordPress, especially those who are building for the platform, consulting, creating SaaS products, or otherwise deriving their income from the software.</p>
<p>Human Made employs a large contingent of WP REST API team members and subsidizes much of their work on the project. The agency is heavily investing in the future of WordPress and is leading the way in helping developers learn how to build with the REST API. If you want to further your skills in this area, Human Made is also organizing an educational event called <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-day-of-rest-conference-session-highlights-now-available-tickets-selling-fast" target="_blank">A Day of REST</a>, which will be held on January 28, 2016. Attendees will have the opportunity to learn from the developers who are building the API as well as those who are already using it in production.</p>

<p>Developers interested in contributing to the creation of a BuddyPress REST API met for the first time yesterday to discuss a path forward. <a href="https://twitter.com/bronsonquick" target="_blank">Bronson Quick</a> is leading the project with the help of <a href="http://modemlooper.me/" target="_blank">Ryan Fugate</a>. Quick works for <a href="https://hmn.md/" target="_blank">Human Made</a> and is a WordPress core contributor. He is also the lead contributor on <a href="https://github.com/Chassis/Chassis" target="_blank">Chassis</a>, a lightweight WP Vagrant install that uses Puppet for provisioning.</p>
<p>John James Jacoby set up <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST" target="_blank">a GitHub repository</a> where development for the BP REST API will take place. In summarizing the meeting&#8217;s discussion regarding planning and architecture, Quick said, &#8220;Planning how we tackle this is very important rather than diving straight into the code. As we‚Äôre &#8216;standing on the shoulders of giants&#8217; we can use the lessons learned from the WP REST API project and put in time at the start to plan this properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes sense to plan out the data we would like returned from endpoints and how they relate to each other with _links. For example, if we‚Äôre displaying the data for the activities endpoint rather than showing a user_id we should link this to a user endpoint.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team will be taking a ‚Äúschema first‚Äù approach and plans to adhere to Test Driven Development &#8211; planning an endpoint, writing tests that fail then writing the code for the endpoint until the tests pass.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is something that‚Äôs often talked about as being an ideal development methodology but it‚Äôs rarely practiced in the WordPress space,&#8221; Quick said. &#8220;Tackling a project this way should mean less bugs although I do realize this could be a blocker for new contributors.&#8221;</p>
<p>The BP REST API team plans to tackle read-only endpoints first for the activity stream and xprofile components via the _links method Quick outlined. Ryan Fugate opened a GitHub <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST/issues/1" target="_blank">issue</a> regarding the plugin&#8217;s folder structure/loader, and the plan is to design it as a feature plugin that will one day land in BuddyPress core.</p>
<h3>What is the Purpose of a BP REST API?</h3>
<p>During the meeting contributors discussed the primary problems that a BP REST API should solve, which Quick summarized in the <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/01/14/bp-rest-api-dev-chat-summary-for-january-14-2016/" target="_blank">meeting notes</a>.</p>
<p>The team agreed that the main purpose for building the API is to expose BuddyPress data in a RESTful way so that developers and site owners can use it to create plugins, mobile apps, or anything else they want.</p>
<p>&#8220;The other main purpose for the BP REST API is that we can use the endpoints going forward to alter some things internally in BuddyPress, as in the past &#8216;the functions throughout BuddyPress are very purpose built to solve one specific theme-side problem,'&#8221; Quick said.</p>
<p>If you want to get involved in building a REST API for BuddyPress make sure to <a href="https://github.com/buddypress/BP-REST/" target="_blank">follow the project on GitHub</a> and jump into the discussion happening in the #buddypress Slack channel.</p>

<p>The WordPress app on mobile offers publishing access to all the sites you have hooked up, which is a pretty powerful door to the world that you may not want to leave unlocked for anyone who gains access to your phone. That&#8217;s why many users have opted to set up a pin lock for the app. (You can find this under Settings >> Turn Pin lock on.) The fingerprint scanner is a faster alternative to using a pin.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fingerprint.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50535"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/fingerprint.png?resize=281%2C500" alt="fingerprint" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-50535" /></a></p>
<p>Version 4.9 also adds several key refinements to the media library experience, including a brand new  design for the details screen to match the rest of the app&#8217;s material design. The app now supports better handling of multiple photo and video uploads.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/media-details.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50537"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/media-details.png?resize=281%2C500" alt="media-details" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-50537" /></a></p>
<p>This release fixes a few bugs, most importantly one where posts were deleted instead of sent to the trash. If you accidentally lost a post this way, hoping to recall it, the problem shouldn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>Version 5.0 RC 1 was released to beta testers today via the Google Play Store beta channel. They are currently testing new WordPress.com &#8220;Site Settings&#8221; and &#8220;My Profile&#8221; screens that will allow users to change settings like site title, tagline, and public display name (among others). Look for these features in the next major release of WordPress for Android.</p>

<p>In 2010 Google patented its methods for <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US8645362" target="_blank">using resource load times in ranking search results</a>. The published patent describes how Google factors in page speed when presenting results:</p>
<blockquote><p>A search result for a resource having a short load time relative to resources having longer load times can be promoted in a presentation order, and search results for the resources having longer load times can be demoted. The demotion can, in some situations, result in a search result for a resource having a short load time being presented earlier in the order than a search result for a similarly-relevant resource having a longer load time. Thus, for two resources that, apart from load times, appear to equally satisfy a user&#8217;s informational needs, the user will often select the resource that will likely load the most quickly of the two, resulting in a better user experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, when it comes to competing resources that might seem otherwise similar, the one that loads faster gets a higher ranking. Prioritizing site speed is not only <a href="https://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html" target="_blank">important for Google rankings</a>, it&#8217;s also critical to providing the best experience for visitors.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/" target="_blank">WP Asset Clean Up</a> plugin addresses an often overlooked aspect of improving loading times. The plugin allows you to selectively remove unused styles and scripts from any page or post on your site. Once activated, the plugin detects all assets loaded and displays them on the post/page editing screen. You can then select the assets that are not needed for that page.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-asset-clean-up.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50520"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/wp-asset-clean-up.png?resize=1025%2C902" alt="wp-asset-clean-up" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50520" /></a></p>
<p>I tested it and found that it works as expected. It&#8217;s especially handy for home pages and content like &#8220;about&#8221; and &#8220;contact&#8221; pages where you don&#8217;t need to load as much functionality.</p>
<p>WP Asset Clean Up is developer <a href="http://www.bitrepository.com" target="_blank">Gabriel Livan</a>&#8216;s first free plugin on WordPress.org.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve used themes / plugins in the past that were loading lots of assets (.css and .js files) in the front-end in pages where you only needed half of them or even less,&#8221; Livan said. &#8220;Many people have articles about making WordPress faster, but they often overlooked this part of removing the unused files. Often these are minified by caching plugins, but using the plugin I&#8217;ve developed, the minifying will be even smaller.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as plugin/theme authors have properly enqueued their assets, WP Asset Clean Up will be able to detect them so that you can select them for removal. The plugin helps you decrease the number of HTTP requests loaded but can also be useful for minimizing script conflicts. You can download <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-asset-clean-up/" target="_blank">WP Asset Clean Up</a> from WordPress.org and use it in combination with your favorite caching plugin to improve performance.</p>

<p>BuddyPress contributors <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/buddypress/p1452110516002730" target="_blank">met last week</a> to discuss the scope of the 2.5 release, which is slated for the beginning of March. Lead developer Paul Gibbs opened the meeting with a call for tickets that contributors are working on for 2.5.</p>
<p>Core developer Mathieu Viet will be working on <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6482" target="_blank">comment syncing between activity and post comments for Custom Post Types</a>. His patch is currently awaiting more testing and feedback. In a separate <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6772" target="_blank">ticket</a> Viet is also working alongside core developer @r-a-y on BuddyPress embeds for activity, user profiles, groups.</p>
<p>BuddyPress lead developer Boone Gorges will be focusing his attention on <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6534" target="_blank">Navigation API tweaks for single items</a> and a ticket to <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6413" target="_blank">move xprofile field data visibility to be stored in xprofilemeta</a> (as opposed to a serialized array in usermeta).</p>
<p>Paul Gibbs is working on <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6592" target="_blank">overhauling BuddyPress emails with a new Email API and customization features</a>. The proposal he&#8217;s working towards uses a Post Type for email templates and a Taxonomy to store the different types of emails BuddyPress sends. This project would also introduce new HTML email templates into the BP template stack and new classes to represent an email (BP_Email), one for each type of email.</p>
<p>Other features on the <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/roadmap" target="_blank">roadmap</a> for possible inclusion in 2.5 include <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6210" target="_blank">a new Invitations API</a>, <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6347" target="_blank">making xprofile fields used for signup configurable</a>, and <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6766" target="_blank">companion stylesheets for the TwentyTwelve default theme</a>.</p>
<h3>BP-API Development Chat Starts This Week</h3>
<p>On Wednesday, following the regularly scheduled dev chat, contributors interested in discussing the <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/this-wednesday-in-addition-to/" target="_blank">REST API and BuddyPress</a> will meet at <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converted.html?iso=20160113T22&p1=3581&p2=195&p3=137&p4=152&p5=158&p6=64" target="_blank">22:00 UTC</a>. During this first chat they will decide where the BP-API will be developed and what steps are necessary to move forward. A few independent API plugins already exist but contributors hope to unify developer efforts to work on an official feature plugin.</p>
<p>This week&#8217;s dev chat will include discussion regarding what project lead John James Jacoby has called <a href="http://wptavern.com/john-james-jacoby-on-navigating-buddypress-identity-crisis" target="_blank">BuddyPress&#8217; identity crisis</a>. The core team will be gathering feedback on a ‚ÄúSocial Network‚Äù vs. ‚ÄúCommunity Software‚Äù marketing direction.</p>

The colors and icons are not something users can define by default.

<p>To add icons, images, or colors to taxonomy terms such as categories and tags, I recommend using <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-images/">WP Term Images</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-icons/">WP Term Icons</a>, and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-colors/">WP Term Colors</a>. All three plugins are developed by, <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/">John James Jacoby,</a> and are part of <a href="http://wptavern.com/stuttter-plugins-now-available-on-wordpress-org">his Stuttter project</a>.</p>
<p>Note, that in order to assign icons, images, and colors to taxonomies in WordPress 4.3 or earlier using these plugins, you&#8217;ll need to install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-term-meta/">WP Term Meta</a> plugin as it adds Term Meta support.</p>
<p>Once all three plugins are installed and activated, browse to the Categories section of the WordPress backend. You&#8217;ll see new fields where you can assign an icon, color, and image. Icons use the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/#admin-appearance">Dashicon set</a> that ships with WordPress.</p>

<p>Choosing a color is easy as WP Term Colors uses the built-in color picker provided by WordPress.</p>

<p>WP Term Images uses the WordPress Media Library to assign an image. Here&#8217;s what a category looks like with a color, image, and icon.</p>

<p>The visual queues are only displayed on the taxonomy management page. In a future update, I&#8217;d like to see visual queues in the same areas of the WordPress backend where a taxonomy is displayed. For example, displaying the icon, color, or image for a category on the Post management screen. The category management page is something I rarely visit once a site is established. However, I visit the Post management screen on a daily basis. At the same time, I question the usefulness of displaying something next to individual tags.</p>
<p>These plugins are examples of what&#8217;s possible with taxonomy term meta support in WordPress 4.4. I tested each plugin on WordPress 4.5 alpha and didn&#8217;t experience any problems. If you&#8217;d like to learn more about term meta and how to use it, I encourage you to <a href="http://themehybrid.com/weblog/introduction-to-wordpress-term-meta">read this tutorial</a> by Justin Tadlock. What use cases or scenarios can you think of where the visual queues described above would come in handy?</p>

It can get out of control depending on the number of custom post types registered and plugins that add a top-level menu. If you want to hide rarely used menus from the admin menu, check out the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/clean-wp-admin-menu/">Clean WP Admin Menu</a> plugin developed by,<a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/borantula/"> Bora Yal√ßƒ±n</a>.</p>
<p>After activating the plugin, browse to the <strong>Settings &gt; Clean Admin Menu</strong> area in the WordPress backend. This is where you choose which menus to hide. Checking the box next to an item will hide it from view.</p>

<p>If you need to access a hidden menu, click the <strong>Toggle Extra</strong> link. Here&#8217;s an animated GIF provided by Yal√ßƒ±n that shows how it works.</p>

<p>Accessing a menu that&#8217;s hidden becomes a two-click process instead of one, but it&#8217;s a trade-off users might make in order to achieve a cleaner interface. Menus are hidden globally and are not tied to user accounts.</p>
<p>Yal√ßƒ±n may add the ability to specify whether a menu is hidden globally or per-user in a future update in addition to a &#8220;Smart Clean&#8221; option. The idea is that if a user hasn&#8217;t accessed a menu in a certain amount of time, the plugin will automatically hide it from view.</p>
<p>I tested <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/clean-wp-admin-menu/">Clean WP Admin Menu</a> on WordPress 4.5 alpha and it works as expected. This plugin is a proof of concept so if you have any feedback or features you&#8217;d like to see added, please provide them in the comments.</p>

It went faster than any year I can remember, absolutely flew by. Luckily it was capped at the holidays with a precious few weeks of downtime in Houston. Now I&#8217;m back to work¬†in Cape Town and just finished a lovely day of great food, wine, and conversation with colleagues who are here for a meetup¬†starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>Since I started tracking, 2015 was the first year that I traveled fewer miles than the year before, clocking in at 398k, down 27k. (398,553 miles, 111 cities, 20 countries.) In 2016 I&#8217;m going to try and get that even lower. It was also one of my best years for blogging on this site, with the most posts (252) I&#8217;ve made since 2008, and the most words (24,605) since 2005. (If anyone is curious, I wrote about 60k words over the same time period in <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic&#8217;s</a> internal <a href="http://p2theme.com/">P2s</a>.) In a weird omission, though, it&#8217;s the first year since this site started in 2002 that I didn&#8217;t post a single gallery of photos. I&#8217;ve developed a mental block around processing and posting the fancier pictures, even as I carry hundreds of gigabytes of them around the planet several times over. Hopefully this is something I can get past in 2016.</p>
<p>I ran 163 miles in¬†2015, more than I did the year before, and I think¬†that trend will¬†continue. Last year <a href="https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/">I talked about habits and small actions</a>, and a daily todo list with some small items to nourish the mind, soul, and body has become central to my routine. I dyed my hair (grey) just for fun and also to show the rest of Automattic they could too, how you look doesn&#8217;t matter one iota. My restaurant quest¬†has continued, and I&#8217;ve now been to 38% of <a href="http://www.theworlds50best.com/list/1-50-winners">the current top 50 list</a>.</p>
<p>More so than before, I really don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s around the corner. While there is a lot in motion, there is even more still being defined and started. There&#8217;s freedom in the groove, to reference <a href="http://joshuaredman.com/">Joshua Redman&#8217;s</a> great album, and I&#8217;m getting a lot more comfortable with ambiguity and the faster pace of life in general. More than ever, I consider myself incredibly lucky, so it&#8217;s exciting to make the most of the opportunity that the volatility, love, loss, glory, failure, inspirations, and setbacks that 2016 will bring.</p>

<p>The whole collection of plugins from John James Jacoby&#8217;s <a href="http://jaco.by/2015/10/16/meet-stuttter/" target="_blank">Stuttter project</a> is now <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stuttter/#content-plugins" target="_blank">available on WordPress.org</a>. Jacoby created Stuttter as &#8220;a conduit for rethinking WordPress from the outside in,&#8221; and started pushing the plugins to the official plugin directory a couple months ago.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2015, he worked full-time on WordPress&#8217; sister projects (BuddyPress, bbPress, and GlotPress), thanks to the <a href="http://wptavern.com/buddypress-bbpress-and-glotpress-development-campaign-is-now-fully-funded" target="_blank">successful funding</a> of his independent IndieGoGo campaign. After completing this project, Jacoby returned to consulting via Flox where he had the chance to test and use the Stuttter plugins in production.</p>
<p>&#8220;It‚Äôs a way to independently test the waters for what we can do with it [WordPress], without deviating from its history, beauty, charm, and chutzpah,&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was recently inspired by Jeremy Felt‚Äôs <a href="https://jeremyfelt.com/2015/10/02/what-wordpress-plugins-are-excellent/" target="_blank">post about what he looks for in plugins</a> that he would want to use. We‚Äôve chatted about it before, and he finally put it into words. Stuttter sticks to those philosophies (no nags, no licenses, nothing to cut out, etc‚Ä¶),&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/stuttter/#content-plugins" target="_blank">Stuttter profile on WordPress.org</a> is home to 18 lean plugins, each carefully chiseled to do one thing well.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter-plugins.png" rel="attachment wp-att-50458"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/stuttter-plugins.png?resize=1025%2C1001" alt="stuttter-plugins" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-50458" /></a></p>
<p>&#8220;My end goal is to point most public facing links for each plugin to a product on <a href="https://store.flox.io/" target="_blank">store.flox.io</a> (using Easy Digital Downloads) and sell them for a few pennies, and then use WordPress.org for updates and distribution,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;That way people get a zip of a plugin they purchased and get to &#8216;own&#8217; their copy, plus I have a record of their purchase on <a href="https://flox.io/" target="_blank">flox.io</a> so they can use that plugin on their hosted networks eventually too.</p>
<p>Jacoby plans to make the Stuttter plugins available on Flox for the communities hosted there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of them will be on by default, like WP Chosen and WP Pretty Filters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Others will be &#8216;unlocked&#8217; through purchases, like User Activity and User Parents.</p>
<p>&#8220;The goal is to strike a balance between a good default experience, and letting people upgrade through purchases, and then being able to take those purchases with them if they decide to self-host eventually (vs. losing them like on wpcom),&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>
<p>Developers who are interested in the code can find the Stuttter plugins <a href="https://code.flox.io/groups/stuttter/" target="_blank">publicly mirrored on Flox</a>. They are actively developed there and then pushed out to <a href="https://github.com/stuttter" target="_blank">GitHub</a> in bulk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost all of these are ideas I‚Äôve been imagining in one way or another for years, particularly WP User Profiles,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;I‚Äôve wanted that for BuddyPress forever, but it‚Äôs always been too big of a gamble to commit to something this drastic for a project like BuddyPress that is so well established.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think whenever you have a long time to imagine what life would be like once something is possible, you can execute very quickly once it is. Most of the current generation Stuttter plugins came rapid-fire because of several years of thought about them first. I hadn‚Äôt even done much research into alternatives (the Stream plugin vs. WP User Activity for example, and WooCommerce has its own Term Meta tweaks too). I just knew I wanted to solve a certain problem in a certain way, and had the time and motivation to make it happen,&#8221; he said.</p>
